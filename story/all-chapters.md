# Introduction

Midyear, Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting and Printmaking, Aqeel Ahmed Solangi, Head of Painting and Sculpture, and Esmaeil Arbab Shahestan, Incharge of the Traditional Art & Craft Programme, collaborated to organize the annual art exhibition at Lahore's prestigious National College of Arts. This once-in-a-year exhibition is especially for students and faculty members of NCA. 

The main exhibition hall of NCA started filling with various paintings and sculptures from all around the world, but one caught everyone's eye. At the gallery's heart, men in black gloves, led by Chief Security Officer Javed Akhtar, carefully mounted a vintage painting: an elderly woman with piercing eyes. Positioned at the center of the exhibition hall, her gaze seemed to follow every viewer, commanding attention.
    
The canvas looked aged, adding to the painting's mysterious feel. Every wrinkle on the woman's face was carefully painted, each one telling a different story. The shadows on her cheeks made her look almost ghostly, and her tightly pressed lips hinted at secrets she was keeping.
    
The background was dark and simple, making the woman stand out even more. Her clothes were plain and worn, suggesting a hard life full of experiences. The painting's realistic details made it both fascinating and a little unsettling, drawing everyone closer to her sad and wise gaze.

The atmosphere turned tense as a thick rope barrier was placed around the painting. A stark sign read: Do Not Touch the Painting. Do Not Cross the Boundaries. CURSED. Uneasy murmurs rippled through the crowd, some pale-faced and wide-eyed with apprehension. 

"Cursed? What does that mean?" one person asked nervously. Others laughed it off, dismissing the sign as a dramatic joke. 

"They can't be serious," someone chuckled, shaking their head. But despite their reactions, everyone was drawn to the painting, their curiosity piqued by the eerie warning.

There were so many rumors about this painting, and many people had felt something weird connected to it. 

"This painting has traveled across continents," Ayesha Mariam Durrani murmured, her voice barely audible. 

"They say its origins are unknown, but every place it has been displayed, someone... changes. People have reported strange phenomena, shadows moving, whispers in the night. In one gallery, a young artist who studied it obsessively disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a cryptic note: 'She watches'."

The crowd murmured as Prof. Dr. Murtaza Jafri, the Vice Chancellor, spoke in low tones to Bushra Saeed Khan, the Acting Registrar. The eerie atmosphere only intensified when Rida Fatima, the Archivist, whispered to a nearby student, "Legend has it, anyone who dares touch it faces... consequences."

The student's eyes widened in a mix of curiosity and fear. "What kind of consequences?" they asked, their voice barely above a whisper. As others overheard, a sense of unease began to spread through the room. Some people exchanged nervous glances, while others tried to act brave, but it was clear that the warning had made everyone feel a bit uneasy.

Mahrosh Javaid Umrani, a 23-year-old with an effortlessly creative aura, and her close-knit bestie Saim Safder, a 25-year-old with an attitude that mirrored Mahrosh's, were standing around the corner of the hall and staring at the cursed painting. 

Mahrosh nudged Saim. "You thinking what I'm thinking?"

Saim grinned. "Our next project." 

They both thought of an opportunity with this painting. A boundary-pushing project, were there with a single focus: to capture the rumored "cursed" painting that had already stirred up whispers among attendees.

Mahrosh felt a thrill of excitement. This was the kind of challenge she loved. She could already imagine the rush of working on something so mysterious and controversial.

Saim, on the other hand, was already picturing how they could use the painting's eerie aura for their project. The haunting eyes and the dark, unsettling vibes would be perfect to add a touch of intrigue and mystery. He thought about how they could play with lighting and angles to amplify the painting's spooky feel. As the whispers around them grew, they knew this was their chance to create something truly unforgettable.

The two navigated the crowd, pretending to film the surroundings. Their curiosity intensified as they saw Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari, the System Manager, setting up cameras around the painting as if trying to catch something on film.

Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari looked cautious and serious. His eyes darted around, checking every detail. "Make sure these angles cover every inch of the painting," he muttered to himself. The cameras he was setting up were sleek and modern, with large lenses and sturdy tripods. He carefully adjusted each one, making sure they were in the right position.

He also had some other equipment with him, like motion sensors and small lights, placing them strategically around the painting. "We can't miss any movement, no matter how small," he said, his voice firm. His focused and meticulous manner made it clear he was determined to capture whatever was happening with the "cursed" painting.

As he worked, a curious onlooker asked, "Do you really think there's something to catch?"

Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari glanced at them, his expression grim. "We'll find out soon enough," he replied, turning back to his task with a determined look.

"Odd, isn't it?" murmured Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari to Faheem Zawar, the IT Administrator.

"Haunted, they say," Faheem replied with a nervous chuckle.

Syed adjusted another camera, his face serious. "Did you hear about the last place this painting was displayed?" he asked quietly.

Faheem nodded, his eyes widening. "Yeah, some gallery in Europe. They said strange things started happening, lights flickering, cold drafts, even whispers in empty rooms."

Syed glanced at the painting, his expression grim. "And what about the curator who touched it?" he continued.

Faheem's voice dropped to a whisper. "They say he had a series of accidents afterward... broke his leg, his house caught fire, and then..." He hesitated, looking around nervously.

"And then?" Syed prompted.

Faheem swallowed hard. "And then he disappeared. No one knows what happened to him."

Syed's gaze lingered on the painting for a moment before he turned back to his equipment. "Let's hope we can capture something tonight. Whatever it is, we need to know the truth."

Their conversation left a heavy silence in the air, as the tension in the room grew palpable.

Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting and Printmaking, caught Mahrosh's attention with her intense gaze. "You two should leave that painting alone," she said. "Some things are better left in the dark." 

She leaned in closer, her expression full of concern. "Do you know what happened last time someone ignored the warnings?" Ayesha asked, her voice low and serious. "They started having nightmares, seeing strange things... and eventually, they had to leave the university." She's trying really hard to scare them.

Ayesha's eyes revealed she knew more than she was saying, but she chose her words carefully. "I'm telling you this for your own good. Please, don't make the same mistake."

Her warning only fueled Mahrosh and Saim's interest even more, but now they were even more aware of the risks involved.

Standing close to the painting, Mahrosh and Saim absorbed its every detail. As Mahrosh locked eyes with the elderly woman on the canvas, an icy shiver coursed through her, as though the temperature had plummeted. She crossed her arms tightly, an instinctive defense against the inexplicable chill.

Meanwhile, Saim noticed something odd. The lighting near the painting flickered for just a moment, casting strange shadows that seemed to dance around the canvas. He blinked and looked again, but everything seemed normal now.

They exchanged uneasy glances, both feeling a mix of excitement and fear. The sense of something mysterious and possibly dangerous hung in the air, leaving them on edge and eager to uncover the truth behind the "cursed" painting.

# The Touch

Ignoring the cautionary looks from others, Mahrosh and Saim moved closer to the painting. The painting was larger than life, its colors muted but striking. The old woman in the frame seemed to stare directly at them, her eyes glinting as if hiding a secret. A small plaque beneath it read: 'Her Gaze Endures.'

The crowd gave the painting a wide berth, as though afraid to get too close. Whispers drifted through the air, fragments of superstitious murmurs about curses and bad luck.

This whole incident intensifies their curiousity, and now they were more determined then before to capture the horrigying and eerie feeling in high resolution. As they leaned in, the tension around them grew.

"Let's get a close-up," Mahrosh whispered, her voice barely audible over the hushed murmurs of the crowd. She could feel her heart racing with excitement and a bit of fear.

As they got closer, their curiosity peaked. Without thinking, both of them reached out at the same moment. Their fingers brushed against the painting's surface, the surface was unexpectedly rough, almost like cold sandpaper, and the icy jolt felt like it reached into their very bones. Mahrosh gasped as her heart seemed to skip a beat, while Saim's knees buckled slightly. sending an unexpected chill through their bodies. They froze for a second, as if the painting itself was alive and reacting to their touch.

For a brief moment, Mahrosh thought she heard a faint whisper, indistinct yet chilling, as though the painting itself were exhaling a warning. The room seemed to hold its breath, and for a moment, everything was silent.

The lights flickered as the room fell silent. For a second, the old woman's eyes seemed to flash, following their movements.

"Did... did you feel that?" Mahrosh stammered, eyes wide with shock.

Saim nodded, breathless and still reeling from the icy jolt. "We need to get out of here. Now."

They quickly pulled their hands away from the painting, exchanging anxious glances. The tension broke just enough for them to share a nervous laugh, though the fear lingered.

As they made their way through the crowded halls, giggles of relief escaped them, exhilarated by the thrill of their rebellious act. They darted past curious onlookers, not stopping until they were outside.

The cool evening air hit them, refreshing after the stifling atmosphere of the gallery. Mahrosh leaned against a nearby pillar, catching her breath. She looked at Saim and noticed him frowning as he examined his wrist.

"Hey, what's wrong?" she asked, her voice still shaky.

Saim held up his right wrist, revealing a strange, dark mark forming—a faint outline, almost like a bruise, spreading across his skin in an unfamiliar shape. "I don't know," he murmured, rubbing at it. "It doesn't hurt, but... it's weird."

Mahrosh took a step closer to examine the unusual mark on Saim's wrist, "It looks like a bruise, but... it's so weird," she said, reaching out to touch it.

The mark was dark, almost unnatural, standing out starkly against his skin. They exchanged a tense glance, both uneasy but trying to brush it off.

"Guess we really got what we asked for," Saim joked weakly, attempting to lighten the mood.

Mahrosh forced a smile. "Maybe it's just a weird reaction to the paint or something."

They walked together, trying to shake off the unsettling experience. But as they moved away from each other slightly more 2 meters, a strange sensation settled over Mahrosh. Mahrosh clutched her chest, her breaths coming in shallow gasps as her vision blurred at the edges. Her knees wobbled, and she stumbled, forcing Saim to grab her arm to steady her.

Noticing her discomfort, Saim stepped back toward her, "Mahrosh! Are you okay?" he asked, his voice rising in alarm. Suddenly, she felt normal. They looked at each other, a spark of realization dawning on their faces.

Mahrosh's voice dropped to a whisper, her eyes wide. "What if... this is because of the painting? What if it did something to us?" Her mind raced with possibilities, each more horrifying than the last.

Saim clenched his fists, his voice laced with frustration. "This can’t be real. There has to be a logical explanation—there has to be." But even as he said it, doubt gnawed at the edges of his certainty.

The two cautiously took small steps away from each other, only to find that once they crossed a certain distance, the feeling of suffocation crept back over her, retreating again as Saim stepped back closer.

They exchanged worried looks. Something was definitely wrong, and it seemed that whatever bound them now was more than just a mark on Saim's wrist—it was something far darker, and it kept them tethered in a way neither had anticipated.

As they moved farther from the gallery, a low hum began to resonate in their ears, faint but insistent. Mahrosh glanced back and froze, she could have sworn the old woman in the painting was now smiling.

# Bound by the Curse

Mahrosh and Saim decided they needed to understand what was happening. They found a quiet spot within the university to test the curse again.

"Let's see if it happens here too," Saim suggested, his voice shaky but determined.

Mahrosh nodded. They cautiously took small steps away from each other, counting the distance. When they reached about two meters apart, Mahrosh felt the tightness in her chest return, while Saim felt nothing unusual.

"Are you feeling it?" Saim asked, his eyes wide with concern.

"Yes," Mahrosh replied, gasping slightly. "It's just like before."

They stepped back closer, and the symptoms faded. They exchanged worried looks, realizing this wasn't just a coincidence.

"We can't ignore this, Saim," Mahrosh said, her voice trembling. "Something is definitely keeping us tied together."

Saim nodded, still trying to process everything. "Yeah, but what can we do about it? It's not like we can just undo a curse."

Mahrosh sighed, feeling the weight of the situation. "I don't know. But we have to accept that we're stuck together for now. Whatever this is, it's real."

Saim looked at the dark mark on his wrist and then back at Mahrosh. "I guess we just have to figure out how to deal with it until we can find a solution."

"Saim... We need to be together. We are stuck." Mahrosh said in disblief. She was scared, her mind was not ready to accept their strange bond

As the unsettling reality of their situation dawned on them, Saim took a step back, scratching his head in disbelief.

"Mahrosh, I... can't be here like this. You know I'm married," he said, voice laced with frustration and concern. "Staying with you like this - it's going to create problems."

Mahrosh's heart sank as the enormity of the situation hit her. She looked away, her face growing pale. "But... what am I supposed to do?" she whispered. "I can't breathe when you're not close. It's like... it's like I'm being strangled from the inside." Her voice broke slightly, betraying her fear.

Saim shook his head, his gaze darting around as if searching for answers. "There has to be a way to break this... connection. Maybe it's just temporary. Maybe it fades after a while."

They stood in silence, the weight of the situation pressing down on them both. The only sounds were their own breaths and the distant hum of students still lingering near the exhibition hall. Finally, Saim spoke up, his voice low.

"Look," he said, "I'll try to find a way around this without... causing issues with my wife. But Mahrosh, if this curse or whatever it is doesn't break soon, we'll have to find another solution."

Mahrosh's eyes lit up with an idea. "Wait, I remember a book," she said. "There was an old book displayed next to the cursed painting. It might have some information about this."

Saim's interest was piqued. "Do you think it could help us?" he asked, hope creeping into his voice.

"It's worth a shot," Mahrosh replied, determination replacing her fear. "Let's go back and check it out."

Without a second thought, she turned and sprinted toward the exhibition hall, barely registering Saim's shout as she broke the invisible two-meter boundary. The tightness gripped her chest, each step harder than the last. She stumbled, wheezing, and stopped, clutching her throat as panic flooded her.

Saim quickly caught up, his face etched with worry. "Mahrosh, are you insane? You can't just..." He cut himself off, realizing her desperation. He took her arm, steadying her.

Saim glanced back toward the exhibition hall and nodded. Together, they hurried back through the quieting corridors, feeling the weight of curious eyes as they slipped past lingering students and faculty. Finally, they reached the painting, the old woman's eyes seeming to watch them with silent amusement.

There, lying just off to the side on a small, dark wooden stand, was the book. Saim picked it up gingerly, and they examined it together, the leather cover worn and embossed with intricate designs. As they opened it, Mahrosh's heart sank. The script was unfamiliar, flowing in elaborate, unreadable patterns.

"It's... Arabic, I think," Saim murmured, his brow furrowing. "But we don't have a clue what any of this means."

"Maybe... someone else does." Mahrosh scanned the hall, her gaze landing on Professor Ahmed, a linguistics instructor known for his knowledge of ancient languages. She didn't hesitate, pulling Saim along as they approached him.

"Sir!" Mahrosh called out, and Professor Ahmed turned, eyebrows raised as he noticed the book in Saim's hands.

"Young lady, where did you find that?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.

"By the painting," Mahrosh explained breathlessly. "We think... we think it might have something to do with what's happening to us."

Professor Ahmed looked from her to Saim, as if weighing the seriousness of their request. Finally, he nodded. "Bring it by my office tomorrow," he said. "If there's anything in here about that painting's... effects, I'll do my best to find it."

Mahrosh exhaled, feeling a flicker of hope. "Thank you, sir. We'll be here first thing."

As they turned to leave, she and Saim exchanged a look. Tomorrow held no guarantees, but it was a start. And for now, as unsettling as their forced closeness felt, at least they weren't facing it alone.

Saim sighed, glancing at Mahrosh with a mix of frustration and concern. He knew he couldn't leave her, not like this. He took out his phone, hesitating as he dialed his wife's number. The ring felt like it lasted forever, and when she finally answered, her voice was warm and familiar, grounding him amidst all the chaos.

"Hey, Saim," she said brightly, sensing his hesitation. "Everything okay?"

Saim took a breath, trying to gather his thoughts. "Something... strange happened at the exhibition tonight," he began. "Mahrosh and I touched this old painting, and... well, I know this sounds insane, but it's like we're cursed or something. Every time we get more than a couple meters apart, Mahrosh can't breathe." He paused, waiting for her reaction.

There was a brief silence, then a soft, incredulous laugh. "You're serious, aren't you?" she said, her tone switching from amusement to concern.

"Dead serious," he replied, casting a glance at Mahrosh, who was clutching her arms tightly, avoiding his gaze. "I can't leave her alone, not until we figure this out. I wanted to know if... well, if you'd mind if she stayed with us tonight."

To his relief, his wife's response was immediate and understanding. "Of course, Saim. Bring her. This sounds terrifying, and I'm sure she must be shaken up."

Saim felt a weight lift off his shoulders. "Thank you, really. I knew you'd understand."

His wife chuckled, her voice full of warmth. "I've heard of some strange things, but this... let's just say you'll have to tell me everything."

As he hung up, he looked at Mahrosh, who gave him a weak smile. "Your wife... she's okay with this?"

"Yeah, she is," he said, feeling a sense of calm for the first time that evening. "She'll help us figure this out too."

Mahrosh texted her father, "I am staying at my friends home... I will be back home tomorrow." She lied, but it seems to be the only way for her. She can't just say, "I am spending a night with a boy." 

They left the college together, the looming presence of the cursed painting still weighing on their minds. Mahrosh kept close as they walked, still tense from their shared ordeal. By the time they arrived at Saim's apartment, the fatigue of the night was settling over them, a strange heaviness as they prepared to face the unknown.

# The Time Together

The two of them entered the house. Each of them with a tension on their face for what could happen, or what could be the reaction of Aisha. But the things turned different. 

Saim's wife, Aisha, greeted them at the door with a warm smile, pulling Mahrosh into a gentle hug. "You're safe here," she reassured her. "Whatever's going on, we'll figure it out together."

Mahrosh felt a surge of gratitude, her fear momentarily easing. She wasn't alone. Together, they would face whatever darkness lay ahead, and somehow, they would find a way to break free of the curse.

---

In the dimly lit dining room, the three of them sat in silence, the weight of the curse pressing down on them. Mahrosh absently traced a finger around the rim of her glass, her mind racing. Saim's wife, Aisha, studied Mahrosh with a gentle, thoughtful gaze, doing her best to appear unruffled by the strange predicament they had found themselves in.

Finally, Mahrosh broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. “Why am I the only one having trouble breathing?”

Aisha leaned back, glancing thoughtfully between Mahrosh and Saim. “It’s strange, definitely,” she agreed, “but maybe there’s a reason for it… perhaps it’s something to do with gender?”

Saim raised an eyebrow, exchanging a puzzled look with Mahrosh. “Gender?” he repeated, uncertain. “How could that make a difference?”

Aisha hesitated, organizing her thoughts. “Think about it,” she explained slowly, “if the curse binds based on a need for connection, maybe it manifests differently depending on who the connection is with. If Mahrosh were tethered to another woman, maybe they’d both feel the same symptoms, like the suffocation. But with you—”

“You’re saying that the curse affects us differently because he’s a man?” Mahrosh finished, her eyes widening. “So that’s why I’m suffocating, but Saim’s not.”

“Possibly,” Aisha nodded. “I’ve read about curses in folklore that affect people differently, depending on things like family ties, gender, or even specific fears or vulnerabilities.” She paused, glancing at Saim. “And it doesn’t necessarily mean the same effects for each person.”

Saim shook his head, frowning as he tried to piece it together. “So the curse is trying to keep us close—specifically close enough for Mahrosh not to feel that… suffocation. And since we’re not bound in the same way, she’s the one suffering if we’re too far apart.”

A silence fell over the room as the implications of Aisha’s theory settled in. Mahrosh’s hands began to shake slightly, and she clenched them tightly together to steady herself. “So, what do we do?” she whispered, glancing up at Saim and Aisha. “If this curse is tied to gender, how do we break it?”

Aisha considered this, her face calm but eyes sharp with determination. “There might be a way. If it is gender-based, we need to test whether the curse behaves the same way with someone else—a woman who hasn’t yet touched the painting.” She looked at Mahrosh with a hint of hesitation. “Someone you trust, who could potentially take Saim’s place, even just to understand the curse’s boundaries.”

Mahrosh’s eyes widened in alarm. “You’re suggesting that I… ask another woman to touch it?” The very thought sent a chill down her spine.

“I know it sounds risky,” Aisha said softly, “but we need answers. And if it means we can lessen your suffering… it might be worth trying.”

The room fell into tense silence as Mahrosh, Saim, and Aisha weighed the decision ahead. The path forward was uncertain, and whatever lay beyond it would demand even more courage and trust than they had shown so far.

Saim’s face darkened as he absorbed Aisha’s suggestion, his jaw clenching. “Absolutely not,” he said firmly, his tone leaving no room for debate. “First, the painting won’t even be there anymore. It was a temporary display for the exhibition, so there’s no chance of anyone else touching it. And second,” he added, his eyes narrowing as he looked from Aisha to Mahrosh, “I won’t allow anyone—Mahrosh, you, or anyone else—to go near that cursed thing. It’s dangerous. We’ll find another way to break this curse.”

Mahrosh sighed, feeling the tension in the room grow thick enough to cut through. She appreciated Saim’s protectiveness, but there was a stubborn streak in his voice that made the situation feel all the more hopeless. Aisha pressed her lips together, giving her husband a sidelong look but not pushing the issue further.

Sensing the growing heaviness of the conversation, Saim leaned back in his chair, suddenly flashing a mischievous grin. “Alright, Mahrosh,” he said, crossing his arms with an exaggeratedly relaxed air, “since I’ve risked my life—on multiple occasions now—trying to keep you alive, I think it’s time you paid me back.”

Mahrosh’s eyebrows shot up, her anxiety momentarily pushed aside by surprise. “What?”

“Tea,” he said, with a smug smile. “A nice, steaming cup. Oh, and don’t forget to press my shoulders. My muscles are all sore from chasing after you.” He raised an eyebrow, clearly trying to lighten the mood. “If you disobey, just saying, I might decide to test the curse myself… by running right out the door.”

Mahrosh gaped at him, caught between exasperation and a reluctant smile. “Saim, that’s not fair!”

“Hey, we all have to make sacrifices,” he replied, smirking. “Now, tea—and maybe a little shoulder massage, if you please.” He leaned forward, pretending to stretch his legs toward the door. “Or I might just make a break for it.”

Aisha let out a surprised laugh, shaking her head. “Saim, really?” she teased, clearly amused. “You’re blackmailing her into making tea?”

“Not just tea,” he corrected, grinning wider. “Tea with a side of obedience.” He leaned back, winking at Mahrosh. “Now get to it before I change my mind.”

Mahrosh rolled her eyes, feigning annoyance but feeling a smile tugging at her lips as she stood up, moving toward the kitchen. “Fine, but don’t think this makes you any less cursed,” she muttered. “You’re more cursed than ever.”

As she filled the kettle, the laughter that followed her was warm and genuine, softening the edges of the grim reality they all faced.

# The Solution

The next morning, the gravity of their situation weighed heavily as Saim and Mahrosh walked towards Professor Ahmed's office. The campus was bustling with the usual activity, but for them, it felt like they were walking through a fog.

Arriving at the professor's office, Saim knocked gently on the door. "Come in," came the familiar voice, and they stepped inside, the old book clutched tightly in Saim's hand.

Professor Ahmed looked up from his desk, his sharp eyes focused on the duo. "You two seem to have had quite a night," he remarked, motioning for them to sit. "Let's see this book you mentioned."

Saim handed over the book, and the professor began to leaf through it with practiced ease. As he scanned the ancient text, his brow furrowed in concentration. After a long moment, he looked up, his expression serious.

"This is not a simple curse," he began. "It is deeply rooted in ancient rituals and requires more than just a quick fix. However, there is mention of a way to temporarily alleviate the symptoms." He paused, making sure they were following. "To store energy."

Mahrosh and Saim exchanged puzzled looks. "Store energy?" Mahrosh repeated.

Professor Ahmed nodded. "The book suggests that physical touch can store energy between the cursed individuals. This stored energy can give you temporary relief from the curse's effects."

"How does it work?" Saim asked, his curiosity piqued.

"According to the text, engaging in some form of physical contact—holding hands, hugging, or even kissing—for an extended period can store enough energy to keep the curse at bay for a limited time. If you maintain physical contact for about an hour, Mahrosh will have approximately 24 hours of freedom from the curse's effects."

Mahrosh blushed slightly at the thought but nodded. "Alright, if that's what it takes."

Outside the office, Mahrosh and Saim exchanged awkward glances. The idea of physical touch to store energy felt strange and uncomfortable.

"I am not kissing you," Mahrosh declared firmly.

"Neither do I," Saim replied, equally resolute.

With a sigh, Mahrosh extended her left hand and interlocked her fingers with Saim's right hand. "Eww," Saim muttered, but he didn't pull away. Mahrosh used her scarf to tie their hands together, ensuring they wouldn't accidentally separate.

They went about their day, attending classes and completing tasks with their hands bound together. The sight of them holding hands drew curious stares and whispers from their classmates. Many assumed they were a couple deeply in love.

"We are just best friends... and I am married," Saim kept repeating to anyone who asked, but the amused looks and knowing smiles continued.

Despite the awkwardness and the sweatiness of their palms, they managed to store enough energy to give Mahrosh some relief from the curse. As the day went on, they found themselves laughing at the absurdity of their situation, their bond growing stronger with each shared moment.

---

As evening approached, the weight of their circumstances had lessened slightly, replaced by a strange camaraderie. Saim and Mahrosh sat under the sprawling banyan tree on campus, hands still tied with her scarf. The cool breeze offered a small reprieve from the day's suffocating tension.

"Never thought we'd end up like this," Saim mused, half-laughing as he looked at their interlocked hands. "Bound together, literally."

Mahrosh smirked, though her gaze wandered to the horizon, thoughtful. "At least we're figuring it out, right? One awkward step at a time."

Saim nodded. "Yeah, but... what about tomorrow? Or the day after? We can't keep doing this forever." His voice dropped slightly. "I have a wife, Mahrosh. This... whatever it is... can't last."

Mahrosh's chest tightened at his words. Not because of the curse, but because of the unspoken truth hanging between them: they were running out of options.

"You think Professor Ahmed will find a permanent solution?" she asked, her voice tinged with hope.

"He has to," Saim replied. "Until then, we'll manage. Together."

The boundaries they had discovered earlier still held, but at least for now, she could function independently.

# Back Home  

Mahrosh finally reached home, the warm glow of the porch light offering a false sense of comfort. Steeling herself, she stepped inside, only to find the living room steeped in an unsettling silence. Her Amma and Abba sat on the sofa, their faces taut with unspoken emotions. The muted hum of the ceiling fan was the only sound, and it grated against Mahrosh's nerves.  

She hesitated, her fingers gripping the edge of the door as it clicked shut behind her. "Asalamualaikum," she greeted softly, her voice breaking the stillness.  

Her Amma replied curtly, not meeting her eyes. "Walaikum Salam." Her tone carried the weight of disappointment.  

Mahrosh's heart sank, and she turned toward the kitchen, hoping for some clarity. There, she found her elder sister Rabia, chopping vegetables with deliberate force, her movements sharp and purposeful.  

"Rabia," Mahrosh asked cautiously, "what's going on? Did something happen?"  

Rabia glanced up, her expression a mix of concern and irritation. She hesitated before setting the knife down. "Ali told them," she said flatly.  

Mahrosh frowned, confused. "Ali? Told them what?"  

Rabia sighed, folding her arms. "That you were with a boy. He saw you and Saim together on campus."  

Mahrosh froze, her breath catching. "But Saim is just my best friend!" she protested, her voice rising in disbelief. "And he's married!"  

Rabia shrugged, her tone edged with resignation. "You know how Amma and Abba think. They don't care if he's married or not. They only care how it looks to other people. And now they're upset because it looks bad."  

Fuming, Mahrosh stormed into the living room, her anger simmering just below the surface. "Amma, Abba, I didn't do anything wrong," she said, her voice trembling with emotion. "Saim is my friend, and that's all. You can't assume the worst just because someone saw us together."  

Her father, who had been silent, finally looked up, his tone low and measured. "We're not saying you did anything wrong, Mahrosh. But you need to understand how people talk. It's about our family's reputation. We can't afford to give anyone reason to gossip."  

Mahrosh bit her lip, trying to contain the anger threatening to spill over. "I won't stop being friends with him," she said firmly. "He's helped me through so much, and I'm not going to let baseless assumptions ruin that."  

Her mother sighed, her expression softening slightly. "Just... be careful," she murmured. "That's all we ask."  

Before Mahrosh could respond, the sound of a chair scraping against the floor caught her attention. Ali, her cousin, stepped out from the adjacent room. His smug expression made her blood boil.  

"You should be thankful I told them," Ali said, his voice laced with self-righteousness. "I'm just looking out for you. Someone needed to stop you from making a fool of yourself."  

Mahrosh turned on him, her eyes blazing. "Who the hell are you to decide what I do with my life?" she snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through the tension.  

Ali flinched but quickly recovered, crossing his arms. "I'm family, Mahrosh. It's my responsibility to make sure you don't ruin our name..."  

"Ruin our name?" Mahrosh interrupted, her voice trembling with fury. "By what? Having a friend? You don't get to control me or dictate my choices. You're not some moral authority, Ali, so stay out of my life."  

Ali's face darkened, but he stayed silent, sensing that any retort would only escalate the situation.  

"Next time," Mahrosh continued, her voice icy yet trembling, "keep your judgments and gossip to yourself. You've done enough damage already."  

Her words hung in the air like shards of glass, sharp and cutting. Ali stiffened, his mouth opening as if to retort, but the fire in her eyes silenced him. The room seemed to shrink under the weight of her anger, every breath taut with tension.  

Without waiting for a reply, Mahrosh turned on her heel, her fists clenched tightly at her sides. Her footsteps pounded up the stairs, each step echoing her frustration and hurt. She stormed into her room, slamming the door behind her with a force that rattled the walls.  

Once inside, her defiance crumbled. The air felt thick, and her chest heaved as tears began to fall, hot and unrelenting. She staggered to her bed, collapsing onto it as the sobs broke free. The emotions she had fought to keep at bay now overwhelmed her, a tempest of anger, humiliation, and exhaustion.  

She buried her face in her pillow, muffling the sounds of her cries. Her shoulders shook as she let the tears soak through the fabric, the reality of the confrontation cutting deeper than she'd expected. The weight of her family's expectations pressed down on her like an anchor, their voices still echoing in her mind.  

But beneath the heartbreak, a flicker of defiance burned, stubborn and unyielding. Through the tears, Mahrosh whispered to herself, her voice raw but determined, "They don't get to control me. Not Ali. Not anyone."  

The room felt cold and still, but that single spark within her refused to be extinguished. Even as she cried, Mahrosh knew she wouldn't let their judgment define her. She would face this, just as she always had... with strength forged from the fire of her struggles.

# It Started Again

Mahrosh's two days past with ease but on the second morning, as she sat in class, an all-too-familiar tightness began to creep over her chest. At first, she tried to ignore it, assuming it was just nerves or the stress of the past few days. But as the minutes passed, her breathing grew more labored, and she clutched at her desk for support.

"I... I can't..." she gasped, her vision beginning to blur.

Nur, the friend sitting beside her, noticed immediately. "Mahrosh, what's wrong?" she asked, her voice panicked.

"I need... Saim," Mahrosh managed to choke out, barely audible.

Nur didn't waste a second. She darted out of the classroom, searching the nearby halls. Moments later, Saim appeared in the doorway, his face a mask of worry. He rushed to Mahrosh's side, kneeling beside her.

"Mahrosh! I'm here. Look at me," he said, gripping her hand tightly. As soon as their hands touched, the suffocating feeling eased, her breaths coming more freely.

The classroom fell silent, all eyes on them. Saim ignored the stares, his focus solely on Mahrosh. "You okay now?" he asked softly, his tone gentle.

She nodded weakly, tears brimming in her eyes. "I... I don't know what happened."

Saim helped her to her feet, his arm steadying her. "Let's get out of here," he said, guiding her toward the hallway.

The whispers followed them as they left, but neither of them cared. For now, the only thing that mattered was figuring out why this was happening... and how to stop it before it tore their lives apart.

Sitting on the edge of the university's grassy ground, Mahrosh and Saim leaned against a bench, their expressions filled with both exhaustion and contemplation. The campus buzzed with life around them, but their conversation felt removed, as if they existed in a separate world entirely.

"One hour is not a day," Mahrosh said, frustration evident in her voice. She twisted her scarf between her fingers, her brows furrowed in thought. "I was okay for less than 24 hours this time."

Saim nodded, his face serious. "We need to figure out what's going on with this curse. It's like... it's inconsistent."

Mahrosh paused, her mind racing back to their earlier attempts to store energy. "Wait," she said suddenly, sitting upright. "Remember the day we held hands for four hours? I didn't feel anything for two whole days after that. That's double the time!"

Saim's eyebrows shot up as he considered her words. "Four hours equals two days? That means the longer we... um..." He trailed off, glancing awkwardly at their hands.

"Yeah," Mahrosh finished, meeting his gaze. "The longer we stay connected, the more energy gets stored. But it's not practical to do that here."

"Exactly," Saim said, his tone firm. "We can't just sit around holding hands at the university. People already think something's going on between us, and I can't risk making it worse. My wife trusts me, but this would... it'd look bad."

Mahrosh sighed, nodding in agreement. "You're right. We need a place where no one will see us. Somewhere outdoors, where we won't be judged or questioned."

They fell into silence, their minds working in sync. After a moment, Saim spoke up, a hint of hesitation in his voice. "There's a park outside near Anarkali. It's usually quiet, especially during the weekdays. We could go there and... you know, spend more time trying this energy thing."

Mahrosh tilted her head, considering the idea. "That might work," she said slowly. "But what if someone still recognizes us? People talk, Saim. They'll make it worse than it already is."

Saim's gaze turned serious as he studied Mahrosh's face. Her unease was clear, and it mirrored his own. This curse wasn't just tying them together; it was slowly dismantling their lives, piece by piece.

"You're right," Saim said finally, his voice steady. "We can't risk being seen there. But this isn't just about appearances anymore. Your health is on the line. If we don't figure this out, it'll only get worse."

Mahrosh leaned back, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of her scarf. "Then what do we do? We can't just keep hiding and hoping no one notices."

A moment of silence passed between them, the weight of the curse pressing down heavily. Saim's mind raced, searching for an answer. Then it hit him.

"There's one more option," he said carefully.

Mahrosh looked up, her brow furrowed. "What is it?"

Saim hesitated, glancing around to ensure no one was within earshot. "The rooftop of my apartment building," he said carefully. "It's private, quiet, and no one goes up there. We could figure this out without anyone watching."

Mahrosh frowned, her unease growing. "But what about Aisha? She's been understanding so far, but if someone like Ali gets wind of this…" Her voice trailed off, the potential fallout hanging heavy between them.

Saim ran a hand through his hair, frustration etched on his face. "I know it's risky, but what other option do we have? The park isn't safe, and your house…"

"Is out of the question," Mahrosh finished, sighing. "My parents are already on edge because of Ali's interference."

Saim leaned forward, his voice steady but firm. "I'll talk to Aisha. I'll explain everything. She trusts me, Mahrosh, and I'll make sure she knows this is about survival, not... anything else."

Mahrosh nodded slowly, though her doubt lingered. "And what if Ali finds out? You know he'll twist this into something ugly."

Saim hesitated, glancing around cautiously. "We'll have to be smart about this," he said. "What about the rooftop of my apartment building? It's private, quiet, and we can figure this out without anyone watching."

Mahrosh shook her head immediately. "I can't risk being there too late, Saim. If Ali finds out, he'll blow it out of proportion, and my parents will never believe it's innocent. I can't keep sneaking around like this."

Saim sighed, running a hand over his face. "Okay, you're right. Then we'll go during the day, but only for short periods—when people are least likely to notice. I'll let Aisha know in advance, so there's no misunderstanding."

Mahrosh's eyes widened. "You'd tell Aisha?"

"Yes," Saim said firmly. "She trusts me, and I don't want this to become a source of tension. If she knows what's happening, we won't have to hide anything."

Mahrosh's shoulders slumped as she considered the plan. "And what about Ali? He's practically looking for a reason to cause trouble."

"We'll make it look normal," Saim replied. "If anyone asks, you're helping me with a project. No late-night meetups, no suspicious behavior. We'll keep this as low-profile as possible."

Mahrosh exhaled slowly, her mind racing through the possibilities. The rooftop was still risky, but with Aisha aware and precautions in place, it might just work.

"Alright," she said, her voice tinged with hesitation. "But if Ali or anyone else so much as raises a question, we stop immediately."

"Deal," Saim said, his tone softening. "We'll be careful, Mahrosh. I promise."

# A Terrifying Discovery

It was next afternoon, Mahrosh and Saim sat huddled over a laptop in the quietest corner of the university library, their faces illuminated by the pale glow of the screen. They had stumbled upon a website https://itisusama-writer.github.io/fake-articles/. A local website, claiming to host rare academic papers and personal accounts about paranormal phenomena. With trembling fingers, Mahrosh clicked on an article titled "The Haunted Portrait: Paris Exhibition's Mysterious Attraction." As they read, the weight of the curse grew heavier with every line. The painting, it turned out, had a dark history of ensnaring individuals.

However, it was a one of the article, "The Roll Number Curse - Masooma Zehra's Haunting Experience." that left them breathless. The story detailed the experience of an NCA student named Masooma Zehra, who had endured a similar curse with her sister, tethered together by a bond they couldn't escape. As Mahrosh read further, a chilling realization dawned: Masooma's roll number matched hers exactly, suggesting that it might be the continuing of a cycle connected to the painting.

Saim leaned back, running a hand through his hair. "This is bigger than us," he muttered. "If Masooma went through the same thing, we need to find her."

"And not just her," Mahrosh added, her voice shaking. "The article mentions a demonologist...Usama, who specializes in curses like this. If anyone can help us figure out what's happening, it's him."

Their search had given them two names, two potential lifelines. Now, all they had to do was find them.

Saim and Mahrosh wasted no time. They approached the administration office at NCA, carefully crafting a story about needing to contact Masooma Zehra for a research project. After some initial hesitation, the staff agreed to check their records.

"You're in luck," the administrator said, handing them a slip of paper. "We still have her contact information from her graduation year."

Mahrosh's heart raced as she copied down the number. "Thank you," she said quickly, clutching the paper tightly as they left the office.

Outside, they found a quiet bench under the shade of a tree. Mahrosh stared at the number for a moment before dialing it, her fingers trembling slightly. She pressed the phone to her ear, Saim sitting beside her with a look of cautious anticipation.

The line clicked, and a soft, slightly wary voice answered. "Hello?"

"Hi, is this Masooma Zehra?" Mahrosh asked, her voice steady despite the knot in her stomach.

"Yes, who's this?" Masooma's tone was polite but guarded.

"I'm Mahrosh Javaid, a student at NCA," she began. "I came across your name in an article... about the painting."

There was a pause on the other end, followed by a sharp intake of breath. "The painting?" Masooma repeated, her voice now tinged with tension.

"Yes," Mahrosh confirmed. "I think... I think I'm going through what you went through. The suffocation, the bond... everything."

Another pause. "Where are you right now?" Masooma finally asked, her voice quieter.

"At the university," Mahrosh replied. "Please, we need your help. Can you tell us how you managed?"

Masooma sighed, her voice softening. "I'll try. What do you want to know?"

"Do you have a mark?" Saim interjected, leaning closer to the phone. "On your wrist, like a bruise or... anything unusual?"

"No," Masooma replied immediately. "Neither I nor my sister ever had any physical marks. It was just... the suffocation. And the bond."

"How did you survive it?" Mahrosh asked, her voice cracking slightly.

"It's not hard for us," Masooma admitted. "We're sisters. We've always lived together, so staying within two meters isn't a problem. It's just how our lives are now."

Mahrosh exchanged a glance with Saim, her chest tightening. "So you never tried to break it?"

Masooma hesitated. "We did... once. But the consequences were worse than the curse itself. You don't want to go down that road."

"What do you mean?" Saim asked urgently.

Masooma's voice dropped, the weight of her words palpable even over the phone. "There's no way to break the curse, not without paying a price... one that's too high. Death... that's the only escape."

The line went silent for a moment before Masooma continued, her tone shifting slightly. "But if you're looking for a way to make it easier, to store energy faster... Usama can help. He's a demonologist. He helped me and my sister. He can teach you how to manage the curse, but breaking it? That's not something he'll promise."

"Where can we find him?" Mahrosh asked, gripping the phone tightly.

"I'll send you his contact," Masooma replied. "Just be prepared. He'll help you survive, but you won't like everything he has to say."

Before Mahrosh could ask more, the line went dead. She lowered the phone slowly, her knuckles white as she gripped it.

"What did she mean, 'you won't like what he has to say'?" Mahrosh murmured, more to herself than to Saim.

"What the hell this Usama is going to say?..." Marosh whispered to herself, expression of anger on her face.

Saim leaned back, his jaw tight. "I don't know, but if this is the only way forward, we don't have a choice."

The words hung between them, heavy and foreboding, as if the curse itself was listening.

# The Meeting for Help

The tension between Mahrosh and Saim didn't ease as they stared at the number Masooma had sent. After a long silence, Mahrosh sighed and dialed. Saim leaned in, his expression unreadable as the call connected.

"Hello?" a deep, calm voice answered.

"Is this Usama?" Mahrosh asked hesitantly.

"Yes," the voice replied, carrying an air of authority. "Who's calling?"

"My name is Mahrosh Javaid. I... Masooma Zehra suggested we contact you. She said you might be able to help us with... a curse."

There was a pause on the other end, long enough that Mahrosh glanced nervously at Saim. Then Usama spoke again, his tone careful but direct. "Tell me where you are and what's happening to you."

Mahrosh recounted their experience... the suffocation, the bond, and the cursed painting. Usama listened in silence, his breathing steady but deliberate.

"I know this curse," Usama finally said, his voice dropping an octave. "The energy I'm sensing... it's from the Old Lady."

"The Old Lady?" Saim repeated, frowning.

"It's what we call her... the entity tied to that painting," Usama explained. "Her energy is distinctive and dangerous. If you're caught in her web, you won't escape unscathed."

"What can we do?" Mahrosh asked quickly, desperation creeping into her voice.

"I can meet you," Usama replied. "We'll talk in person. Pak Tea House tomorrow afternoon. Two o'clock."

---

The bustling atmosphere of Pak Tea House was in stark contrast to the unease in Mahrosh and Saim's hearts. They sat at a corner table, glancing around anxiously until a ordinary, composed young man approached them.

"Mahrosh? Saim?" he asked, his piercing eyes locking onto theirs.

They nodded, and he slid into the seat across from them. "I'm Usama," he said simply.

From the moment they shook hands, Usama's expression shifted, his gaze sharpening. "I can feel it," he murmured, his tone almost reverent. "The energy is unmistakable. The Old Lady's presence is clinging to you both."

Mahrosh swallowed hard. "Can you help us?"

Usama leaned back, studying them. "I can help you manage it... to store the energy, to make it easier to live with. But breaking this curse..." He trailed off, his lips pressing into a thin line.

"Breaking it isn't possible?" Saim asked, leaning forward.

Usama hesitated, glancing briefly at Mahrosh before focusing on Saim. "There's one way. A bond of this nature can sometimes be overpowered by another bond... one that is equally unbreakable."

Usama nodded, pulling out a small notebook and scribbling something down. "There's a way to store energy more efficiently, but it requires trust. Are you both willing to do whatever it takes?"

Mahrosh nodded without hesitation. "Yes."

Saim hesitated, his eyes narrowing. "What exactly does it involve?"

Usama looked between them, his expression serious. "Saim, your blood. The bond ties the two of you together, but sharing your life force will allow Mahrosh to sustain herself for longer periods without needing your proximity."

Mahrosh blinked in surprise but nodded. "If it'll help, I'll do it."

Saim stared at Usama, his fists clenched. "You want me to... inject my blood into her?"

"Yes," Usama said matter-of-factly. "A small amount. It's symbolic as much as it is practical. Her body will respond to the bond by absorbing the energy more directly."

Saim shook his head, his discomfort evident. "This is insane."

"You said you wanted to save her," Usama said sharply. "This is the safest way to make that happen. And 1mm will last her for whole week. Although it is better than holding hands."

Mahrosh placed a hand on Saim's arm, her voice steady but soft. "Saim, I'll be okay. If this works, it'll buy us time to figure out the rest."

Saim sighed, rubbing his temples before nodding reluctantly. "Alright. Let's do it."

After detailing the procedure, Usama turned to Saim. "Walk with me for a moment," he said.

Saim glanced at Mahrosh, who gave him a questioning look. "I'll be right back," he assured her before following Usama to a quieter corner of the tea house.

When they were out of earshot, Usama faced him, his expression unreadable. "The blood injection will work for now. It'll give her some breathing room, but you need to understand... it's a temporary solution."

Saim's brows furrowed. "You've said that. What's your point?"

Usama's voice dropped, his tone firm. "A bond like this, forged through the Old Lady's curse, isn't just physical. It's emotional, spiritual, all-encompassing. That's why it feeds on proximity. To override it completely, you'd need a bond that's equally unbreakable."

"What are you saying?" Saim asked warily, though he already sensed the answer.

"Marriage," Usama said simply. "A marriage between the two of you would create a bond strong enough to neutralize the curse's effects. It would make the tether natural, rather than forced."

Saim froze, his jaw tightening. "That's not an option," he said flatly.

"I'm not saying you should act on it," Usama replied, his tone measured. "But if you want to ensure her survival and regain some semblance of normalcy, it's the only permanent solution I can see."

Saim clenched his fists, his mind racing. For a brief, fleeting moment, the thought lingered—what if it worked? Could he do it?

"No," he said firmly, shaking his head. "There has to be another way."

Usama sighed but nodded. "Then focus on what we discussed. The blood injection will buy you time. But remember, time isn't on your side."

Saim didn't respond, his jaw tight as he turned back toward Mahrosh. Usama watched him go, his expression thoughtful, before following silently.

# The First Injection 

They ride back from the Pak Tea House in silence. Mahrosh kept staring at Saim, who was gripping the handles of the bike tighter than usual. The suggestion of injecting blood lingered heavily between them, but neither had the energy to discuss further.  

When they reached NCA, Mahrosh hesitated at the enter, unsure if she should step inside. Saim gave her a reassuring nod. "Everthing will be fine," he said softly. "we have to do this. Let's get this over with before it's too late. You have to go back home on time."  

The two made their way to the park, where Saim started unpacking his bag. Inside were syringes, sterile gloves, and small glass vials which he bought on their way back to NCA. Everything looked unsettlingly professional, yet the sight of it sent a chill down Mahrosh's spine.  

"Sit down," Saim instructed. "Saim, roll up your sleeve."  

Saim hesitated for a moment, his jaw tightening. "Are you sure about this?" He gave Mahrosh a look. "It's not going to harm you, and it will stabilize you for a week. as Usama said. But remember, this is just a temporary solution. We have to do this every week."  

Mahrosh watched Saim reluctantly roll up his sleeve, exposing his arm. And tied a rubber band around it, finding a vein with practiced ease. The syringe glinted under the dim light, and Mahrosh's breath hitched.  

"Are you okay?" Saim asked, glancing at her.  

She nodded, though her hands trembled slightly. "I'm fine. Just... let's get it over with."  

The needle pierced Saim's skin, and blood filled the syringe, slightly more than 1mm. Saim winced but said nothing, keeping his eyes on Mahrosh. Once the blood was extracted, Saim turned to her.  

"Your turn," He said.  

Mahrosh froze for a moment, her heart racing. She had agreed to this, but now, as Saim approached with the syringe, panic bubbled up inside her.  

"You can do this," Saim said, his voice steady. "We've come this far."  

Taking a deep breath, Mahrosh extended her arm. Saim swabbed the area, then injected the blood into her vein. The sharp sting lasted only a moment, but the weight of what they had done settled over the room like a thick fog.  

"It's done," Saim said. Both looked at each other and smiled.  

Mahrosh sat back, her head spinning slightly. "I feel... normal," she said, her voice uncertain.  

"You will," Saim replied. "The blood will mimic the bond, allowing your body to absorb the energy it craves. But remember... not to push your limits."  

--- 

Saim sat across from Mahrosh in the on the ground in park, her expression unreadable. A silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.  

"Do you think this will actually work?" Mahrosh finally asked, breaking the quiet.  

"I don't know," Saim admitted. "But at least we have a week to figure out our next move."  

Mahrosh nodded, though her unease remained. "What did Usama talk to you about earlier? When he pulled you aside?"  

Saim hesitated, his jaw clenching. "Nothing important," he said quickly. "Just more warnings about the curse."  

Mahrosh narrowed her eyes, sensing he wasn't telling her everything, but decided not to press him. Instead, she leaned back, exhaustion overtaking her.  

"You should go home... or Ali will think of something stupid." Saim said after a while.  

Mahrosh glanced at him, unsure. "What if something happens while I'm there?"  

Saim exhaled sharply. "You'll be fine for a week now. Just... try to rest. We'll meet tomorrow and plan our next steps."  

Reluctantly, Mahrosh stood, grabbing her bag. "Thanks, Saim," she said softly. "For everything."  

As she left, Saim went straight back to his apartment. Right away he enters the room and sank into the couch, rubbing his temples. Usama's words echoed in his mind: 'Marriage would make this easier'  

For a fleeting moment, he considered it again. But the image of Aisha's trusting face flashed before him, and he pushed the thought away.  

---

Later that night, Aisha returned home. She immediately noticed the tension in Saim's posture as he sat on the couch, staring at nothing.

"Hey," she said, setting her bag down. "Rough day?"

Saim forced a smile, but it didn't reach his eyes. "You could say that."

Aisha frowned, sitting beside him. "Is everything okay with Mahrosh? Did you find a solution?"

"We found something," Saim replied vaguely. "Usama suggested a temporary fix. It'll help for now."

At the mention of Usama's name, Aisha froze, her brow furrowing. "Wait. Usama? As in Usama Hassan?"

Saim blinked, confused. "Yeah... how do you know him?"

Aisha leaned back, a small, wry smile crossing her face. "We used to be classmates back in university. We took Astrology and Mythology together as an extra subject. He was always the one with the craziest theories... half of which turned out to be true. I remember he gave a whole presentation about cursed objects that scared the entire class."

Saim raised an eyebrow. "That sounds like him. He's a demonologist now."

Aisha nodded, her expression growing more serious. "I'm not surprised. He always had a fascination with the paranormal. But be careful with him, Saim. Usama means well, but he's not afraid to walk dangerous paths to find answers."

Saim sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "He suggested injecting my blood into Mahrosh to help stabilize her."

Aisha's eyes widened slightly, though her calm demeanor didn't falter. "And you agreed?"

"I didn't have a choice," Saim admitted. "It's the only thing that'll buy us time while we figure out the rest."

Aisha studied him for a moment, her expression unreadable. Then she reached out, taking his hand. "You're doing the right thing, Saim. Helping her. Just... don't lose yourself in this, okay?"

Her words struck a chord, and Saim nodded silently.  

---

The next day, Mahrosh woke feeling better than she had in weeks. The injection seemed to have worked, giving her a newfound energy. But as she arrived on campus, a strange sensation crept over her.  

The suffocation was gone, but something else lingered... a faint, gnawing emptiness, something different, like she was having mixed up thoughts. She seeing things just like Saim.  

Saim noticed it too when they met later that afternoon. "You seem... off," he said, watching her closely.  

"I feel off," Mahrosh admitted. "It's like... I am becoming you. It seems like I am having two personalities inside of me."  

Saim frowned, his unease growing. "We need to keep a closer eye on this. If it changes again..."  

"Let's hope it doesn't," Mahrosh said, though her voice betrayed her doubt.  

The curse wasn't done with them yet, and they both knew it.  

# Unraveling Minds  

Mahrosh stood in front of her bathroom mirror, staring at her reflection. It seems like as if it belonged to someone else. Her hands gripped the sink, knuckles white as she struggled to steady her breathing. The injection had worked... there was no suffocation, no tightness in her chest... but something about her felt wrong, so wrong, as though parts of her mind were no longer her own.  

The reflection in the mirror flickered, her face briefly replaced by Saim's. His worried eyes staring back at her for a moment. She stumbled backward, her pulse racing, but the vision was gone in an instant.

"Get it together," she whispered to herself, splashing cold water on her face.  

At NCA later that morning, the unease lingered. She tried to focus on her lecture, but her thoughts keeps on slipping again and again, as if her mind wasn't entirely her own. When the class ended, she barely noticed Nur waving at her until she grabbed her arm.  

"Mahrosh, are you okay?" Nur asked, her tone laced with concern. "You've been zoning out all morning."  

"I'm fine," Mahrosh lied, forcing a smile. "Just tired."  

Nur didn't look convinced but nodded, releasing her arm. "If you need to talk, I'm here."  

As Nur walked away, Mahrosh's phone buzzed. It was a message from Saim:  

'Get free soon and me near the canteen. We need to talk.'

Saim was already seated when Mahrosh arrived, his face pale and drawn. He looked up as she approached, gesturing for her to sit.  

"You look terrible," Mahrosh said, her voice flat.  

"Thanks," Saim muttered. "You don't look so great yourself."  

Mahrosh hesitated before sitting down, leaning in to speak quietly. "Something's happening, Saim. I think... I think I'm losing control."  

Saim's expression hardened. "You losing control?"  

She stared at him. "I... I saw your face in my mirror this morning. Just for a second. It's like... like we're blending together somehow."  

Saim leaned forward, lowering his voice further. "You have my blood in you. This might effect your vision." After a pause Saim continues, "I ignored it all but since we were stuck in this curse... I started hearing a voice saying 'it's over'"

Saim's jaw tightened. "This curse... it's not just tethering us physically. It's messing with our minds too."  

Before they could discuss further, Mahrosh's phone buzzed again. This time, it was Usama.  

"Pick it up," Saim urged, his voice tense.  

Mahrosh answered, her voice unsteady. "Hello?"  

"Where are you?" Usama's voice was sharp, urgent.  

"On campus," she replied. "Why? What's wrong?"  

"Listen carefully," Usama said. "The injection may have stabilized your physical symptoms, but it's triggering something else... your mental connection to the curse. You need to come to my place immediately."  

Mahrosh glanced at Saim, who nodded. "We're on our way," she said before hanging up.  

---

Usama's apartment was a cluttered but organized space, filled with books, artifacts, and strange symbols etched into the walls. He ushered them inside quickly, his demeanor more intense than before.  

"I've been wanting to tell you this in the Pak Tea House..." he began without preamble. "The Old Lady's curse isn't just about proximity. It's about unity. Complete and utter merging of two individuals. The blood injection act's as a bypass whic ovewrites the original effect of the curse, and that's why Mahrosh will have vision issue."  

"Vission issue. Is this dangerous?" Saim asked, his voice sharp.  

"No... This is just what she will see. It won't do anything physically." Usama assured them.

"You're sharing more than energy now," Usama said grimly. "Memories, emotions, even fragments of your personalities. The curse is trying to force you into a singular existence, two souls becoming one."  

Mahrosh felt the blood drain from her face. "Is there a way to stop it?"  

Usama hesitated, his gaze flicking between them. "Not entirely. But we can slow it down. You need to resist the merging. Stay grounded in who you are. That means avoiding emotional vulnerability, maintaining clear boundaries..."  

"Saim... Can we talk?" Usama asked, he again want's time alone with Saim for a moment.

"Not again..." Mahrosh whispered to herself, irritated.

The guys walked away from Mahrosh once again, and this time Saim guessed what it could be. The marriage.

"See Saim. I know it is totally up to you. But if you guys get married this might break the curse completly. Because then you guys are one soul by default and their is no chance for curse to happen. You know our religion allows you to have a second wife."

During the call Usama got a call from someone, name displaying Abubakar. "I have to go right now. It is important."

Mahrosh and Saim left the apartment and this time they are worried and tensed more then ever before. As they left Usama's apartment, the weight of his words pressed heavily on their shoulders. Mahrosh and Saim walked in silence for a while, each lost in their own thoughts.  

Finally, Mahrosh broke the silence. "Saim... what if we can't stop it?"  

"We will," Saim said firmly, though his voice wavered slightly. "We have to."  

But deep down, they both knew the truth: the curse was evolving, and their time was running out.

# A Descent Into Doubt

The ride back to campus was tense, neither Mahrosh nor Saim saying a word. Saim told Mahrosh about the marriage suggestion and the weight of Usama's suggestion about marriage loomed over them like a shadow, growing darker with each passing moment. The idea wasn't just unsettling; it was impossible. Yet, the seed of doubt had been planted, and neither could completely ignore it.

As they reached NCA, Mahrosh broke the silence. "You're awfully quiet," she said, her voice tinged with frustration.

Saim parked the bike and removed his helmet, avoiding her gaze. "What do you want me to say, Mahrosh? That I'm okay with any of this? Because I'm not."

Her expression softened, but her frustration didn't wane. "Neither am I, but ignoring it won't help us. We need a real plan, Saim. Not just temporary fixes."

Saim exhaled sharply, finally meeting her eyes. "I know. But marriage? Do you even realize what that means for both of us? For Aisha?"

The mention of Aisha struck a chord, and Mahrosh looked away, guilt flashing across her face. "I didn't ask for this either," she muttered. "And for the record, I don't think marriage is the solution."

"Good," Saim said flatly, his tone leaving no room for further discussion. "Because it's not happening."

---

Later that evening, Mahrosh sat alone in her room, staring at her laptop screen. The words from Usama's research paper blurred as her mind raced. The visions, the emotional merging. What did it all mean? And how much of herself would she lose if they couldn't stop it?  

Her phone buzzed, breaking her thoughts. It was Saim.  

"Hey," she answered, trying to keep her voice steady.  

"We need to figure this out," he said without preamble. "I've been thinking... maybe we're approaching this the wrong way."  

Mahrosh frowned. "What do you mean?"  

"We've been focusing on the curse and its effects," Saim explained. "But what if we look into the painting itself? Its origin, its history. There has to be a reason why it's doing this to us."  

Mahrosh leaned back in her chair, considering his words. "You're saying we dig deeper?"  

"Exactly," Saim replied. "We can't rely solely on Usama. He's helpful, but if he's right about time running out, we can't afford to wait around."  

---

The next day, Mahrosh and Saim met in the university library. They pored over books and digital archives, searching for anything connected to the painting. Hours passed, but their efforts seemed futile, until Mahrosh stumbled upon a faded, handwritten catalog entry in an old art journal.  

"Look at this," she said, pointing to a passage.  

Saim leaned in, squinting at the text. "The Lady of Shadows," he read aloud. "An oil painting believed to date back to the late 19th century, attributed to an anonymous artist. Rumored to have mystical properties."  

Mahrosh tapped the screen. "It says here that the painting was originally part of a private collection in Europe but vanished for decades before resurfacing in Paris and now in Lahore."  

Saim's brows furrowed. "Mystical properties? That's putting it mildly."  

"Wait," Mahrosh said, scrolling down. "There's more. 'Accounts suggest the painting curses those who disrupt its sanctity, binding their fates together until a balance is restored.'"  

"Balance?" Saim echoed. "What kind of balance?"  

Mahrosh shook her head. "It doesn't say. But this 'Lady of Shadows'... it's definitely our painting."  

As they packed up to leave, Mahrosh's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number.  

'Meet me at the Fine Arts Building rooftop. Midnight. Bring Saim. Usama'  

Mahrosh showed the message to Saim, who frowned. "Why the rooftop? What's with all the dramatic locations?"  

"Do you want to ignore him?" Mahrosh asked pointedly.  

Saim sighed. "No. Let's see what he wants."  

---

Under the pale moonlight, the rooftop of the Fine Arts Building was eerily quiet. Mahrosh and Saim arrived to find Usama standing near the edge, his back to them as he stared out over the campus.  

"You made it," he said without turning around.  

"What's so urgent that it couldn't wait until morning?" Saim asked, crossing his arms.  

Usama turned to face them, his expression grave. "I've been digging into the painting's origin. The Lady of Shadows isn't just cursed... it's a vessel."  

Mahrosh's heart skipped a beat. "A vessel for what?"  

"For her," Usama said simply. "The Old Lady. She isn't just tied to the painting; she inhabits it. And she's searching for a host."  

Saim's stomach sank. "A host?"  

Usama nodded. "She feeds on the bonds she creates, growing stronger until she can fully possess someone. If you two don't break the cycle, she might become her vessel."  

The words hit like a thunderclap, leaving them reeling.  

"What do we do?" Mahrosh whispered, her voice barely audible.  

Usama's gaze hardened. "You dig deeper. Find out who painted her and why. That's the only way you'll understand how to stop her."  

Saim clenched his fists, his mind racing. "And if we don't find anything?"  

Usama's expression didn't waver. "Then you bot to pay the price. And the price is death."  

The silence that followed was deafening, the weight of the curse pressing down on them heavier than ever.  

As they left the rooftop, Mahrosh glanced at Saim, her voice trembling. "What if I can't do this, Saim?"  

"You're not alone," Saim said firmly, though his own fear was palpable. "We'll figure it out. Together."  

But as they descended the stairs, a chilling thought lingered in both their minds: time was running out, and the Lady of Shadows was waiting.  

# The Forgotten Archive

The following morning, Mahrosh woke to a strange sense of clarity. Despite the lingering tension of Usama's ominous words, her mind felt unusually sharp, as if urging her to act before the curse could tighten its grip. She wasted no time, right on her bed she texted Saim to meet her at the university library.

Today she reached the university thirty minutes before the actual time, and by the time Saim arrived, Mahrosh was already surrounded by books, old journals, and a stack of faded documents she had managed to unearth from the library's restricted archive. The room smelled of aged paper and dust, and the faint hum of the air conditioning created a solemn atmosphere.

"I think you didn't sleep?" Saim asked, setting his bag down.

"Not a minute," Mahrosh replied, not looking up from the journal she was reading. "We need answers, Saim. If what Usama said is true, and this 'Lady of Shadows' is looking for a host..." She trailed off, her voice trembling slightly.

Saim pulled up a chair, his expression grim. "Where do we even start?"

Mahrosh slid a journal toward him. "This is the oldest record I could find about the painting. It mentions an artist named Louis Aubert who lived in Paris during the late 19th century. He was known for his experimental art but disappeared under mysterious circumstances after completing a painting described exactly like ours."

Saim's eyes scanned the page, his brows furrowing. "It says here he was obsessed with a woman named Leila. Someone he claimed could 'channel the divine.'" He looked up at Mahrosh. "Do you think she's the Old Lady?"

"Possibly," Mahrosh said. "But there's more. This journal says that Aubert believed Leila's spirit was bound to the painting, preserving her essence for eternity."

Saim leaned back, his mind racing. "So, he trapped her in the painting?"

Mahrosh nodded. "And she's been using it ever since to search for a new host. Someone she can fully inhabit."

---

Their conversation was interrupted by the librarian, an elderly man with spectacles perched on the edge of his nose. He approached cautiously, carrying a thick, leather-bound ledger. "I couldn't help but overhear," he said softly. "If you're looking into the painting's origins, you might find this useful. It's a record of European art auctions that took place in Lahore decades ago."

Mahrosh and Saim exchanged a glance before eagerly flipping through the ledger. Among the listings, they found an entry dated 1965:  

'The Lady of Shadows: Anonymous Artist. Acquired by A. Shahbaz.'

"Who's A. Shahbaz?" Saim asked, scanning the page for more details.  

"Shahbaz might refer to the Shahbaz family," the librarian said. "They were prominent art collectors in Lahore during the mid-20th century. Their estate was turned into a private gallery after the family's decline."  

"Do you know where this gallery is?" Mahrosh asked urgently.  

The librarian nodded. "It's not far... on the outskirts of the city. But I must warn you, it's been abandoned for years."  

---

By late afternoon, Mahrosh and Saim stood in front of the crumbling gates of the Shahbaz estate. The once-grand mansion was now overrun with vines, its windows shattered and its walls weathered by decades of neglect.  

"This place looks like it belongs in a horror movie," Saim muttered, pushing the gates open with a loud creak.  

Mahrosh tightened her grip on her scarf, her eyes darting around nervously. "If the painting was here, maybe we'll find something about why it's cursed."  

Inside, the air was thick with dust and decay. The remnants of the Shahbaz family's collection were scattered across the main hall... broken frames, faded tapestries, and overturned furniture. They moved cautiously, their footsteps echoing eerily in the vast, empty space.  

In the corner of the hall, they found a large, wooden trunk. Its lock was rusted, but with some effort, Saim managed to pry it open. Inside were stacks of letters, ledgers, and a leather-bound diary with the initials A.S engraved on the cover.  

Mahrosh opened the diary carefully, flipping through its yellowed pages. "It's written by Ahmed Shahbaz," she murmured. "He talks about acquiring the painting at an auction in Paris. He thought it was just a valuable antique, but then... he started noticing strange things."  

Saim leaned closer as she read aloud:  

"The eyes... they follow me everywhere. I hear her voice in my dreams, calling my name. I feel her presence even when I'm alone. She wants something from me, but I cannot decipher her intentions. My family has begged me to get rid of it, but I can't. It's as if she won't let me."  

Mahrosh shivered, her fingers trembling as she turned the page. The final entry was short but chilling:  

"If you're reading this, leave now. The Lady of Shadows is not bound to the painting alone. She can reach beyond it, into those who seek her secrets. Run, before it's too late."  

The diary slipped from Mahrosh's hands, hitting the floor with a soft thud.  

"We need to leave," she whispered, her voice barely audible.  

Saim didn't argue. They turned and hurried out of the estate, the weight of Ahmed Shahbaz's warning heavy in their minds.

---

That night, Mahrosh couldn't sleep. Her dreams were vivid and fragmented, filled with fleeting images of the Old Lady's face, her penetrating eyes staring straight into Mahrosh's soul.  

When she awoke in a cold sweat, her phone buzzed with a message from Saim, "I can feel her too. We're running out of time."

Mahrosh stared at the screen, dread settling in her chest like a stone. Whatever the Lady of Shadows wanted, she was getting closer... and their time to uncover the truth was slipping away.  

# Echoes in the Silence  

Mahrosh sat cross-legged on her bed, the morning light streaming through her curtains casting long, uneven shadows across the room. Her laptop hummed quietly on the bedside table, its screen dark after hours of inactivity. She had spent the night poring over every detail of Ahmed Shahbaz's diary and the auction records, her eyes burning from lack of sleep. The silence in the house felt oppressive, broken only by the occasional distant sounds of her family downstairs. Yet, within her room, it felt as though she wasn't truly alone. The blood injection is still working, keeping her breathing steady, but a gnawing unease had taken its place.

Beads of sweat began to form on her forehead, the air around her growing inexplicably warmer. She wiped her face with the back of her hand but stopped when she noticed her palm trembling. Her shirt clung to her back, damp with perspiration, and a faint dizziness crept in.

"What's happening now?" she murmured to herself, her voice shaky.

Standing abruptly, she stumbled to the bathroom, stripping off her clothes as the humid air pressed against her skin.  Before she could close the bathroom door, a sharp knock echoed from her bedroom door, followed by her sister Rabia's voice.

"Mahrosh? Are you okay?" Rabia called, the concern in her tone unmistakable.

Mahrosh froze, clutching her towel to her chest, her heart racing. "I'm fine!" she shouted back, trying to steady her voice.

The door creaked open slightly, and Rabia's head peeked through. Her eyes darted to the disheveled state of the room, then back to Mahrosh, narrowing. "You don't look fine," she said, stepping inside.

"I said I'm fine," Mahrosh repeated, sharper this time, avoiding her sister's probing gaze.

Rabia crossed her arms, her brows knitting together. "What's going on, Mahrosh? You're pale, sweating... Did something happen?"

Mahrosh shook her head quickly, retreating into the bathroom and shutting the door firmly behind her. "Just give me a minute, Rabia!"

The silence that followed was thick, but Rabia didn't leave. "I'm waiting outside," she said, her voice quieter now, but firm. She continues her shower. 

For a moment, the sensation grounded her, the rhythmic pattering of water on tiles drowning out the frantic hum of her thoughts.

As the water flowed, she closed her eyes, hoping to wash away not just the sweat but the mounting fear as well. However, behind her closed lids, images began to form—flashes of the Old Lady's face, her dark, penetrating eyes locking onto her. Mahrosh gasped, her eyes snapping open as she stumbled backward against the cold tiles.

She turned off the water hastily and wrapped herself in a towel, her chest heaving. This wasn't normal. It wasn't just stress or exhaustion anymore—it was the curse tightening its grip, infiltrating her mind.

Wrapping herself in a towel, Mahrosh hesitated at the bathroom door. She could hear Rabia shifting in the room, her footsteps soft but insistent as they paced the floor. Taking a deep breath, she opened the door.

Rabia turned immediately, her arms still crossed and her expression stern. "Are you going to tell me what's going on now?"

Mahrosh avoided her gaze, walking past her to the dresser. "I told you, I'm fine. It's just... I didn't sleep well last night, that's all."

"Don't lie to me," Rabia snapped, stepping closer. "You've been acting weird for days now. Amma and Abba might not notice, but I do."

Mahrosh's hands froze mid-motion as she reached for her clothes. She could feel Rabia's piercing gaze on her back. Rabia's sharp intake of breath made Mahrosh pause. 

"What is that?" Rabia asked, her voice trembling with a mix of shock and confusion.  

"What's what?" Mahrosh replied, turning her head slightly, trying to see what her sister was talking about.  

Rabia stepped closer, her hand hovering just inches from Mahrosh's shoulder blade. "There's... there's a mark on your back. It looks like a..." She stopped, struggling to find the words.  

Mahrosh spun around, her brows furrowed. "A mark? What are you talking about?"  

Without waiting for permission, Rabia grabbed a small handheld mirror from the dresser and held it up behind Mahrosh. "Here, look for yourself."  

Mahrosh took the mirror with shaking hands, angling it over her shoulder to see her reflection. Her breath caught in her throat. There, etched into her skin just below her left shoulder blade, was a faint, swirling mark. It looked almost like an intricate, ancient symbol... a blend of curves and sharp edges that seemed both beautiful and ominous.  

She ran her fingers over it, the skin smooth to the touch, but the sight of it sent a shiver down her spine. "I didn't... I didn't know this was there," she whispered, her voice barely audible.  

"What is it?" Rabia asked, her tone urgent. "Is it a tattoo? A scar? How long have you had it?"  

"I don't know," Mahrosh said, panic creeping into her voice. "I've never seen it before. I... I don't even know how it got there."  

Rabia stepped back, her eyes narrowing. "Mahrosh, this isn't normal. You've been acting strange, and now this? You need to tell me what's really going on."  

Mahrosh turned away, clutching the towel tighter around herself. Her mind raced, the mark an undeniable reminder of the curse's growing hold on her. But how could she explain it to Rabia without sounding insane?  

"I can't," she said finally, her voice breaking. "You wouldn't understand."  

"Try me," Rabia insisted, her voice softening slightly. "You're my sister, Mahrosh. Whatever this is, I want to help you."  

For a moment, Mahrosh considered telling her everything—the curse, the painting, the suffocation. But the words caught in her throat, and all she could manage was, "I'm fine, Rabia. Just... please, leave me alone for now."  

Rabia hesitated, her concern evident, but she nodded reluctantly. "Fine," she said quietly. "But this isn't over. You need to figure out what's happening to you, Mahrosh, before it's too late."  

As Rabia left the room, Mahrosh sank onto the edge of her bed, the mirror still in her hand. She stared at the mark, dread pooling in her stomach. Whatever this was, it was just another piece of the puzzle—a puzzle that seemed to grow darker and more twisted with every step.  

# Unseen Shadows  

The classroom felt suffocating, the air heavy with a stillness that pressed on Mahrosh's chest. She sat at her desk near the window, the sunlight streaming in doing little to chase away the damp chill that had taken root in her. Her scarf clung to her skin, slick with sweat, and her trembling hands fidgeted with the edge of her notebook.  

Every creak of the door sent her pulse racing until finally, Saim walked in. His sharp eyes scanned the room before landing on her, his expression darkening the moment he saw her pale face.  

"Mahrosh, what's wrong?" he asked, striding across the room to sit beside her. His voice was firm but carried an edge of worry.  

She hesitated, glancing at the other students around them. "I... I'm not okay," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. She leaned in, her eyes darting nervously. "Something new. There's a mark, Saim. On my back."  

Saim's jaw tightened as he leaned closer, their shoulders brushing. "What kind of mark?"  

Mahrosh swallowed hard, her fingers gripping the edge of her desk. "Rabia saw it this morning. She said it's intricate... like a symbol. I didn't even know it was there."  

His brows furrowed, and he leaned forward, lowering his voice further. "Did you take a picture of it? Can I see it?"  

Her cheeks flushed at the thought, and she shook her head. "No, I... I couldn't. It feels... too personal."  

Saim sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Mahrosh, this isn't about personal boundaries anymore. If the mark is part of the curse, we need to figure out what it means. You trust me, don't you?"  

His words stung, not because she didn't trust him, but because she trusted him too much. She nodded reluctantly, her heart hammering in her chest. "I do, but I can't show you. There has to be another way."  

He exhaled deeply, his gaze softening as he placed a steadying hand on the desk between them. "Alright. What if you draw it? Sketch out what Rabia described. We can work with that."  

Relieved, Mahrosh nodded. She reached into her bag, pulling out a blank notebook and a pen. Her hands trembled slightly as she started sketching, the memory of Rabia's worried tone echoing in her ears.  

The lines came hesitantly at first, her mind grappling with the image Rabia had described. Slowly, the swirling curves and sharp edges began to take shape. The pattern wasn't perfect. She hadn't seen it herself, but it carried an eerie elegance, a beauty that unsettled her as much as it intrigued her.  

When she finished, she slid the notebook across the desk to Saim without meeting his gaze. "This is the best I can do," she murmured.  

Saim picked up the notebook, his eyes scanning the symbol with a growing intensity. "This looks familiar," he muttered, flipping through his own notebook. He stopped on a page filled with hastily drawn symbols Usama had shown them during one of their meetings.  

Mahrosh leaned closer, her breath catching as she saw the resemblance. "It's similar, isn't it?"  

"It's a binding mark," Saim said, his voice grim. "Usama mentioned these before. They're used in curses to anchor a connection... like a signature of the entity involved."  

Her stomach churned, dread pooling low in her chest. "So, the Old Lady is... marking me as hers?"  

Saim's silence spoke louder than any words could. His lips pressed into a thin line as he finally met her gaze. "We need to show this to Usama. Immediately."  

Mahrosh nodded, but unease gnawed at her. The mark wasn't just a symbol, it was a claim, a brand of possession that the curse was tightening its grip.  

She clenched her fists, her voice barely steady. "What if... what if this means it's too late? What if she's already winning?"  

Saim placed a hand on her shoulder, grounding her with his steady presence. "She hasn't won yet," he said firmly. "And as long as we're fighting, she never will."  

But even as he spoke the words, they both felt the creeping shadow of doubt. Time was slipping through their fingers, and the Old Lady's grip was stronger than ever.  

# The Heat Within

Saim and Mahrosh sat under the shadow of a towering banyan tree at the far end of campus, their shared tension tangible. The injection kit sat between them, its sterile contents a grim reminder of the lengths they had to go to survive another day.  

"We'll do this again," Saim said, his tone flat as he swabbed his arm with alcohol. "Just to be safe."  

Mahrosh nodded, her gaze fixed on the horizon. "I can’t risk another incident," she murmured.  

Saim extracted a small amount of blood into the syringe, his movements practiced but hesitant. He handed the filled syringe to Mahrosh, who rolled up her sleeve without protest. The sting was brief, but the weight of what they were doing lingered as she leaned back against the tree.  

"That should hold us for another week," Saim said, capping the syringe. His voice carried little relief. "We’ll call Usama tomorrow and figure out our next steps."  

Mahrosh exhaled deeply, her exhaustion evident. "Let’s hope there’s still a next step to take."  

---

The ride home was a blur for Mahrosh, her body drained and her mind heavy with unanswered questions. By the time she stepped inside, the familiar warmth of her house felt oppressive. The air seemed thicker, the walls closer.  

She climbed the stairs slowly, each step an effort. Once in her room, she shut the door firmly and leaned against it, sliding to the floor. Her breathing was steady, but her skin felt like it was on fire.  

The heat was unbearable. She stripped off her clothes, leaving only her undergarments, and lay flat on her bed. Her hair clung to her forehead, damp with sweat, and her sheets grew wet beneath her.  

"What’s happening to me?" she whispered, staring at the ceiling as beads of sweat rolled down her temples.  

Her back ached, the pain dull at first but growing sharper, like claws raking down her spine. She clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms as the pain spread, searing and relentless.  

She turned onto her stomach, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her trembling hand reached back instinctively, fingers brushing against her bare skin.  

The mark.  

It pulsed beneath her touch, a faint heat emanating from it as though it were alive. Her fingers trembled as she traced its edges, the intricate curves and sharp points sending a shiver down her spine.  

And then she felt it—a pull.  

Not physical, but something deeper, something primal. It was as if the mark were a doorway, and something on the other side was trying to claw its way through.  

"No," she gasped, gripping the edge of the mattress as the pain intensified. Her vision blurred, the room spinning as she bit down on her lip to keep from screaming.  

The air around her seemed to ripple, and for a brief moment, she swore she saw a shadow move across her ceiling.  

The Old Lady.  

Her face, her dark, penetrating eyes, flashed in Mahrosh’s mind, clearer than ever before. It wasn’t just a memory—it felt real, as if the Old Lady were standing right behind her, whispering in a language Mahrosh couldn’t understand.  

Her body convulsed, the mark burning like a brand, and she cried out, tears streaming down her face.  

And then, as suddenly as it began, the pain stopped.  

Mahrosh lay motionless, her body slick with sweat and trembling. She turned her head slowly, her gaze falling on the mirror across the room.  

Her reflection stared back at her, but the eyes were wrong.  

They weren’t hers.  

They were dark, empty, and unrelenting—the eyes of the Old Lady.  

Mahrosh screamed, pulling the sheets around her as she scrambled backward against the headboard. The reflection remained unchanged, its cold gaze piercing through her.  

The door burst open, and Rabia rushed in, her face pale with worry. "Mahrosh! What’s going on?"  

Mahrosh pointed a shaking hand at the mirror. "The mirror... it’s her! She’s in there!"  

Rabia turned to the mirror, her expression confused. "Mahrosh, there’s nothing there. It’s just you."  

Mahrosh’s breath hitched as she looked again. The eyes were hers once more, bloodshot and wide with terror.  

Rabia stepped closer, sitting on the edge of the bed. "You’re scaring me. What’s happening to you?"  

Mahrosh buried her face in her hands, her voice trembling. "She’s... she’s inside me. I can feel her."  

Rabia hesitated before stepping closer, her brows furrowed as she looked down at Mahrosh. "You’re burning up," she murmured, placing a hand on Mahrosh’s shoulder. The sweat didn’t seem to cling to her hand the way it drenched Mahrosh’s skin.

"Why aren’t you...?" Mahrosh whispered, her voice breaking.

Rabia frowned. "What?"

Mahrosh shook her head, pulling away slightly. "Why aren’t you sweating? It’s so hot in here... isn’t it?"

Rabia blinked, confused. "Mahrosh, it’s not hot. The room feels normal."

A cold wave of realization swept over Mahrosh, cutting through the oppressive heat she felt. It wasn’t the room. It was her.

The Old Lady wasn’t just near. She was inside.

# The Bad News

The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the campus as Saim made his way to the agreed meeting spot near the Fine Arts Building. His steps were heavy, his thoughts a swirling mess. Mahrosh had taken the day off, claiming she needed rest, but her voice over the phone had been shaky, her words strained.  

Usama stood near the stone bench under an old neem tree, a slim notebook in his hand. His face was calm, but his eyes betrayed a storm of thoughts. When he saw Saim approaching, he gave a curt nod.  

"You came alone," Usama remarked, his tone neutral.  

"Mahrosh's not feeling well," Saim replied, sitting across from him. "She’s burning up, drenched in sweat. She stayed home."  

Usama leaned back slightly, his gaze narrowing. "It’s not just the curse anymore," he said grimly. "I need to tell you what’s happening... and you’re not going to like it."  

Saim stiffened. "What do you mean? Is it getting worse?"  

Usama sighed, closing the notebook in his hand. "The signs are clear. The Old Lady’s presence is no longer external. She’s found her way inside Mahrosh."  

Saim’s stomach twisted. "Inside? You’re saying she’s... possessed?"  

"It’s not full possession yet," Usama clarified, though his voice carried no comfort. "But she’s taken root. The heat, the visions, the mark—they’re all signs. The Old Lady is weaving herself into Mahrosh’s very being. And once the merging is complete..."  

Saim clenched his fists, his voice low and urgent. "What happens then?"  

Usama’s gaze locked onto his, unwavering. "Then Mahrosh is gone. The Old Lady will take over completely, using her as a host. Her soul will be consumed, leaving nothing behind."  

The words hit Saim like a blow, his breath catching in his throat. He leaned forward, his voice desperate. "There has to be a way to stop it. Another injection? Some ritual? Anything!"  

Usama shook his head slowly. "The injections were a temporary fix, a way to delay the inevitable. But this curse... it was designed to end in one of two ways. Either the host fully succumbs, or..." He trailed off, hesitating.  

"Or what?" Saim demanded, his tone sharp.  

Usama leaned in, his voice low and heavy. "Or the bond is severed entirely. And that’s not something the curse allows easily. Severing it means one of you has to..." He hesitated again, the weight of the word hanging unspoken.  

"Die," Saim finished for him, his voice hollow.  

Usama nodded, his expression grim. "It’s not a solution anyone wants, but it’s the reality of this curse. The Old Lady thrives on bonds. If the bond is gone, she loses her hold. But Mahrosh’s body is already marked. She’s the primary target. If we don’t act fast..."  

Saim leaned back, running a hand through his hair. His mind raced with the implications, with the weight of Usama’s words.  

"How long do we have?" he asked finally.  

"Days," Usama replied. "A week at most before she’s gone entirely. And the closer you two stay, the faster it progresses. She’s feeding off your connection."  

Saim’s chest tightened as he tried to process the impossible choices before him. "So, what do we do now?"  

Usama stood, his expression steely. "I’ll look into anything that might delay her progress further, but I won’t give you false hope, Saim. This isn’t something that ends well. Prepare yourself for the worst."  

Saim nodded slowly, his throat dry. As Usama walked away, his words lingered like a shadow over Saim’s thoughts.  

When he finally stood to leave, the weight of the curse felt heavier than ever. Time was running out, and Mahrosh was slipping through his fingers.

# The Final Hours

Mahrosh sat curled on the floor of her room, the dim light of her bedside lamp casting flickering shadows on the walls. The heat that had plagued her all day had grown unbearable, her skin burning as though flames licked at her from the inside. She clutched a damp towel to her face, but it did nothing to ease the fever or the growing weight in her chest.  

Her phone buzzed on the bed beside her. With trembling hands, she grabbed it, Saim's name flashing on the screen.  

"Mahrosh," his voice came through, tense and urgent. "How are you feeling?"  

She opened her mouth to speak, but all that came out was a shaky breath. The words stuck in her throat, her mind too clouded to form sentences.  

"I’m coming over," Saim said quickly, his tone leaving no room for argument.  

"No," she whispered hoarsely. "It’ll make it worse. Usama said—"  

"To hell with what Usama said!" Saim snapped, his frustration breaking through. "You’re not going through this alone. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes."  

The line went dead, leaving Mahrosh staring at the screen, her heart racing. She tried to stand but collapsed back onto her knees, the room spinning around her. Her vision blurred, and for a moment, she thought she saw the Old Lady’s eyes staring back at her from the dark corners of the room.  

"Get out of my head," she hissed, clutching at her temples.  

The air grew heavy, the shadows in the room deepening. The faint sound of whispers filled her ears, unintelligible but insistent. She tried to block them out, pressing her hands against her ears, but they only grew louder.  

When the knock came at her door, it was sharp and urgent. She dragged herself to her feet, her legs wobbling as she stumbled toward it.  

"Mahrosh?" Saim’s voice called from the other side.  

She opened the door, her vision swimming. Saim stood there, his face pale but determined. He stepped inside without waiting for an invitation, his eyes immediately scanning her appearance.  

"You look worse," he said bluntly, closing the door behind him.  

"Thanks," she muttered, her voice rasping.  

Saim grabbed a chair and pulled it close to her. "Listen to me. Usama said this is it. We don’t have days, Mahrosh. We have hours—maybe less."  

Her legs gave out, and she sank onto the edge of the bed, staring at him. "What does that mean, Saim? What are we supposed to do?"  

Saim hesitated, his jaw tightening. His hand hovered over hers but didn’t touch, as if afraid to make it worse. "There’s one thing we haven’t tried. Something Usama didn’t want to say out loud."  

Mahrosh’s breath hitched, her voice trembling. "What is it?"  

Saim hesitated, his eyes locking onto hers. The room seemed to close in around them, the weight of the curse palpable.  

"It’s... me," he said finally, his voice barely audible. "I have to..."  

The whispers grew louder, drowning out his words as the shadows in the room stretched, reaching for them.  

"Saim," Mahrosh said, her voice breaking, "what are you saying? What are you going to do?"  

But Saim didn’t answer. He stood, his expression unreadable, and turned toward the door.  

Mahrosh reached for him, her hand trembling. "Saim, no. Don’t—"  

The room plunged into darkness, the whispers turning into a deafening roar. For a brief moment, she thought she saw the Old Lady’s silhouette standing behind Saim, her hand outstretched.  

And then...
