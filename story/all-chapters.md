# Introduction

Midyear, Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting and Printmaking, Aqeel Ahmed Solangi, Head of Painting and Sculpture, and Esmaeil Arbab Shahestan, Incharge of the Traditional Art & Craft Programme, collaborated to organize the annual art exhibition at Lahore's prestigious National College of Arts. This once-in-a-year exhibition is especially for students and faculty members of NCA. 

The main exhibition hall of NCA started filling with various paintings and sculptures from all around the world, but one caught everyone's eye. At the gallery's heart, men in black gloves, led by Chief Security Officer Javed Akhtar, carefully mounted a vintage painting: an elderly woman with piercing eyes. Positioned at the center of the exhibition hall, her gaze seemed to follow every viewer, commanding attention.
    
The canvas looked aged, adding to the painting's mysterious feel. Every wrinkle on the woman's face was carefully painted, each one telling a different story. The shadows on her cheeks made her look almost ghostly, and her tightly pressed lips hinted at secrets she was keeping.
    
The background was dark and simple, making the woman stand out even more. Her clothes were plain and worn, suggesting a hard life full of experiences. The painting's realistic details made it both fascinating and a little unsettling, drawing everyone closer to her sad and wise gaze.

The atmosphere turned tense as a thick rope barrier was placed around the painting. A stark sign read: Do Not Touch the Painting. Do Not Cross the Boundaries. CURSED. Uneasy murmurs rippled through the crowd, some pale-faced and wide-eyed with apprehension. 

"Cursed? What does that mean?" one person asked nervously. Others laughed it off, dismissing the sign as a dramatic joke. 

"They can't be serious," someone chuckled, shaking their head. But despite their reactions, everyone was drawn to the painting, their curiosity piqued by the eerie warning.

There were so many rumors about this painting, and many people had felt something weird connected to it. 

"This painting has traveled across continents," Ayesha Mariam Durrani murmured, her voice barely audible. 

"They say its origins are unknown, but every place it has been displayed, someone... changes. People have reported strange phenomena, shadows moving, whispers in the night. In one gallery, a young artist who studied it obsessively disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a cryptic note: 'She watches'."

The crowd murmured as Prof. Dr. Murtaza Jafri, the Vice Chancellor, spoke in low tones to Bushra Saeed Khan, the Acting Registrar. The eerie atmosphere only intensified when Rida Fatima, the Archivist, whispered to a nearby student, "Legend has it, anyone who dares touch it faces... consequences."

The student's eyes widened in a mix of curiosity and fear. "What kind of consequences?" they asked, their voice barely above a whisper. As others overheard, a sense of unease began to spread through the room. Some people exchanged nervous glances, while others tried to act brave, but it was clear that the warning had made everyone feel a bit uneasy.

Mahrosh Javaid Umrani, a 23-year-old with an effortlessly creative aura, and her close-knit bestie Saim Safder, a 25-year-old with an attitude that mirrored Mahrosh's, were standing around the corner of the hall and staring at the cursed painting. 

Mahrosh nudged Saim. "You thinking what I'm thinking?"

Saim grinned. "Our next project." 

They both thought of an opportunity with this painting. A boundary-pushing project, were there with a single focus: to capture the rumored "cursed" painting that had already stirred up whispers among attendees.

Mahrosh felt a thrill of excitement. This was the kind of challenge she loved. She could already imagine the rush of working on something so mysterious and controversial.

Saim, on the other hand, was already picturing how they could use the painting's eerie aura for their project. The haunting eyes and the dark, unsettling vibes would be perfect to add a touch of intrigue and mystery. He thought about how they could play with lighting and angles to amplify the painting's spooky feel. As the whispers around them grew, they knew this was their chance to create something truly unforgettable.

The two navigated the crowd, pretending to film the surroundings. Their curiosity intensified as they saw Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari, the System Manager, setting up cameras around the painting as if trying to catch something on film.

Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari looked cautious and serious. His eyes darted around, checking every detail. "Make sure these angles cover every inch of the painting," he muttered to himself. The cameras he was setting up were sleek and modern, with large lenses and sturdy tripods. He carefully adjusted each one, making sure they were in the right position.

He also had some other equipment with him, like motion sensors and small lights, placing them strategically around the painting. "We can't miss any movement, no matter how small," he said, his voice firm. His focused and meticulous manner made it clear he was determined to capture whatever was happening with the "cursed" painting.

As he worked, a curious onlooker asked, "Do you really think there's something to catch?"

Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari glanced at them, his expression grim. "We'll find out soon enough," he replied, turning back to his task with a determined look.

"Odd, isn't it?" murmured Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari to Faheem Zawar, the IT Administrator.

"Haunted, they say," Faheem replied with a nervous chuckle.

Syed adjusted another camera, his face serious. "Did you hear about the last place this painting was displayed?" he asked quietly.

Faheem nodded, his eyes widening. "Yeah, some gallery in Europe. They said strange things started happening, lights flickering, cold drafts, even whispers in empty rooms."

Syed glanced at the painting, his expression grim. "And what about the curator who touched it?" he continued.

Faheem's voice dropped to a whisper. "They say he had a series of accidents afterward... broke his leg, his house caught fire, and then..." He hesitated, looking around nervously.

"And then?" Syed prompted.

Faheem swallowed hard. "And then he disappeared. No one knows what happened to him."

Syed's gaze lingered on the painting for a moment before he turned back to his equipment. "Let's hope we can capture something tonight. Whatever it is, we need to know the truth."

Their conversation left a heavy silence in the air, as the tension in the room grew palpable.

Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting and Printmaking, caught Mahrosh's attention with her intense gaze. "You two should leave that painting alone," she said. "Some things are better left in the dark." 

She leaned in closer, her expression full of concern. "Do you know what happened last time someone ignored the warnings?" Ayesha asked, her voice low and serious. "They started having nightmares, seeing strange things... and eventually, they had to leave the university." She's trying really hard to scare them.

Ayesha's eyes revealed she knew more than she was saying, but she chose her words carefully. "I'm telling you this for your own good. Please, don't make the same mistake."

Her warning only fueled Mahrosh and Saim's interest even more, but now they were even more aware of the risks involved.

Standing close to the painting, Mahrosh and Saim absorbed its every detail. As Mahrosh locked eyes with the elderly woman on the canvas, an icy shiver coursed through her, as though the temperature had plummeted. She crossed her arms tightly, an instinctive defense against the inexplicable chill.

Meanwhile, Saim noticed something odd. The lighting near the painting flickered for just a moment, casting strange shadows that seemed to dance around the canvas. He blinked and looked again, but everything seemed normal now.

They exchanged uneasy glances, both feeling a mix of excitement and fear. The sense of something mysterious and possibly dangerous hung in the air, leaving them on edge and eager to uncover the truth behind the "cursed" painting.

# The Touch

Ignoring the cautionary looks from others, Mahrosh and Saim moved closer to the painting. The painting was larger than life, its colors muted but striking. The old woman in the frame seemed to stare directly at them, her eyes glinting as if hiding a secret. A small plaque beneath it read: 'Her Gaze Endures.'

The crowd gave the painting a wide berth, as though afraid to get too close. Whispers drifted through the air, fragments of superstitious murmurs about curses and bad luck.

This whole incident intensifies their curiousity, and now they were more determined then before to capture the horrigying and eerie feeling in high resolution. As they leaned in, the tension around them grew.

"Let's get a close-up," Mahrosh whispered, her voice barely audible over the hushed murmurs of the crowd. She could feel her heart racing with excitement and a bit of fear.

As they got closer, their curiosity peaked. Without thinking, both of them reached out at the same moment. Their fingers brushed against the painting's surface, the surface was unexpectedly rough, almost like cold sandpaper, and the icy jolt felt like it reached into their very bones. Mahrosh gasped as her heart seemed to skip a beat, while Saim's knees buckled slightly. sending an unexpected chill through their bodies. They froze for a second, as if the painting itself was alive and reacting to their touch.

For a brief moment, Mahrosh thought she heard a faint whisper, indistinct yet chilling, as though the painting itself were exhaling a warning. The room seemed to hold its breath, and for a moment, everything was silent.

The lights flickered as the room fell silent. For a second, the old woman's eyes seemed to flash, following their movements.

"Did... did you feel that?" Mahrosh stammered, eyes wide with shock.

Saim nodded, breathless and still reeling from the icy jolt. "We need to get out of here. Now."

They quickly pulled their hands away from the painting, exchanging anxious glances. The tension broke just enough for them to share a nervous laugh, though the fear lingered.

As they made their way through the crowded halls, giggles of relief escaped them, exhilarated by the thrill of their rebellious act. They darted past curious onlookers, not stopping until they were outside.

The cool evening air hit them, refreshing after the stifling atmosphere of the gallery. Mahrosh leaned against a nearby pillar, catching her breath. She looked at Saim and noticed him frowning as he examined his wrist.

"Hey, what's wrong?" she asked, her voice still shaky.

Saim held up his right wrist, revealing a strange, dark mark forming—a faint outline, almost like a bruise, spreading across his skin in an unfamiliar shape. "I don't know," he murmured, rubbing at it. "It doesn't hurt, but... it's weird."

Mahrosh took a step closer to examine the unusual mark on Saim's wrist, "It looks like a bruise, but... it's so weird," she said, reaching out to touch it.

The mark was dark, almost unnatural, standing out starkly against his skin. They exchanged a tense glance, both uneasy but trying to brush it off.

"Guess we really got what we asked for," Saim joked weakly, attempting to lighten the mood.

Mahrosh forced a smile. "Maybe it's just a weird reaction to the paint or something."

They walked together, trying to shake off the unsettling experience. But as they moved away from each other slightly more 2 meters, a strange sensation settled over Mahrosh. Mahrosh clutched her chest, her breaths coming in shallow gasps as her vision blurred at the edges. Her knees wobbled, and she stumbled, forcing Saim to grab her arm to steady her.

Noticing her discomfort, Saim stepped back toward her, "Mahrosh! Are you okay?" he asked, his voice rising in alarm. Suddenly, she felt normal. They looked at each other, a spark of realization dawning on their faces.

Mahrosh's voice dropped to a whisper, her eyes wide. "What if... this is because of the painting? What if it did something to us?" Her mind raced with possibilities, each more horrifying than the last.

Saim clenched his fists, his voice laced with frustration. "This can’t be real. There has to be a logical explanation—there has to be." But even as he said it, doubt gnawed at the edges of his certainty.

The two cautiously took small steps away from each other, only to find that once they crossed a certain distance, the feeling of suffocation crept back over her, retreating again as Saim stepped back closer.

They exchanged worried looks. Something was definitely wrong, and it seemed that whatever bound them now was more than just a mark on Saim's wrist—it was something far darker, and it kept them tethered in a way neither had anticipated.

As they moved farther from the gallery, a low hum began to resonate in their ears, faint but insistent. Mahrosh glanced back and froze, she could have sworn the old woman in the painting was now smiling.

# Bound by the Curse

Mahrosh and Saim decided they needed to understand what was happening. They found a quiet spot within the university to test the curse again.

"Let's see if it happens here too," Saim suggested, his voice shaky but determined.

Mahrosh nodded. They cautiously took small steps away from each other, counting the distance. When they reached about two meters apart, Mahrosh felt the tightness in her chest return, while Saim felt nothing unusual.

"Are you feeling it?" Saim asked, his eyes wide with concern.

"Yes," Mahrosh replied, gasping slightly. "It's just like before."

They stepped back closer, and the symptoms faded. They exchanged worried looks, realizing this wasn't just a coincidence.

"We can't ignore this, Saim," Mahrosh said, her voice trembling. "Something is definitely keeping us tied together."

Saim nodded, still trying to process everything. "Yeah, but what can we do about it? It's not like we can just undo a curse."

Mahrosh sighed, feeling the weight of the situation. "I don't know. But we have to accept that we're stuck together for now. Whatever this is, it's real."

Saim looked at the dark mark on his wrist and then back at Mahrosh. "I guess we just have to figure out how to deal with it until we can find a solution."

"Saim... We need to be together. We are stuck." Mahrosh said in disblief. She was scared, her mind was not ready to accept their strange bond

As the unsettling reality of their situation dawned on them, Saim took a step back, scratching his head in disbelief.

"Mahrosh, I... can't be here like this. You know I'm married," he said, voice laced with frustration and concern. "Staying with you like this - it's going to create problems."

Mahrosh's heart sank as the enormity of the situation hit her. She looked away, her face growing pale. "But... what am I supposed to do?" she whispered. "I can't breathe when you're not close. It's like... it's like I'm being strangled from the inside." Her voice broke slightly, betraying her fear.

Saim shook his head, his gaze darting around as if searching for answers. "There has to be a way to break this... connection. Maybe it's just temporary. Maybe it fades after a while."

They stood in silence, the weight of the situation pressing down on them both. The only sounds were their own breaths and the distant hum of students still lingering near the exhibition hall. Finally, Saim spoke up, his voice low.

"Look," he said, "I'll try to find a way around this without... causing issues with my wife. But Mahrosh, if this curse or whatever it is doesn't break soon, we'll have to find another solution."

Mahrosh's eyes lit up with an idea. "Wait, I remember a book," she said. "There was an old book displayed next to the cursed painting. It might have some information about this."

Saim's interest was piqued. "Do you think it could help us?" he asked, hope creeping into his voice.

"It's worth a shot," Mahrosh replied, determination replacing her fear. "Let's go back and check it out."

Without a second thought, she turned and sprinted toward the exhibition hall, barely registering Saim's shout as she broke the invisible two-meter boundary. The tightness gripped her chest, each step harder than the last. She stumbled, wheezing, and stopped, clutching her throat as panic flooded her.

Saim quickly caught up, his face etched with worry. "Mahrosh, are you insane? You can't just..." He cut himself off, realizing her desperation. He took her arm, steadying her.

Saim glanced back toward the exhibition hall and nodded. Together, they hurried back through the quieting corridors, feeling the weight of curious eyes as they slipped past lingering students and faculty. Finally, they reached the painting, the old woman's eyes seeming to watch them with silent amusement.

There, lying just off to the side on a small, dark wooden stand, was the book. Saim picked it up gingerly, and they examined it together, the leather cover worn and embossed with intricate designs. As they opened it, Mahrosh's heart sank. The script was unfamiliar, flowing in elaborate, unreadable patterns.

"It's... Arabic, I think," Saim murmured, his brow furrowing. "But we don't have a clue what any of this means."

"Maybe... someone else does." Mahrosh scanned the hall, her gaze landing on Professor Ahmed, a linguistics instructor known for his knowledge of ancient languages. She didn't hesitate, pulling Saim along as they approached him.

"Sir!" Mahrosh called out, and Professor Ahmed turned, eyebrows raised as he noticed the book in Saim's hands.

"Young lady, where did you find that?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.

"By the painting," Mahrosh explained breathlessly. "We think... we think it might have something to do with what's happening to us."

Professor Ahmed looked from her to Saim, as if weighing the seriousness of their request. Finally, he nodded. "Bring it by my office tomorrow," he said. "If there's anything in here about that painting's... effects, I'll do my best to find it."

Mahrosh exhaled, feeling a flicker of hope. "Thank you, sir. We'll be here first thing."

As they turned to leave, she and Saim exchanged a look. Tomorrow held no guarantees, but it was a start. And for now, as unsettling as their forced closeness felt, at least they weren't facing it alone.

Saim sighed, glancing at Mahrosh with a mix of frustration and concern. He knew he couldn't leave her, not like this. He took out his phone, hesitating as he dialed his wife's number. The ring felt like it lasted forever, and when she finally answered, her voice was warm and familiar, grounding him amidst all the chaos.

"Hey, Saim," she said brightly, sensing his hesitation. "Everything okay?"

Saim took a breath, trying to gather his thoughts. "Something... strange happened at the exhibition tonight," he began. "Mahrosh and I touched this old painting, and... well, I know this sounds insane, but it's like we're cursed or something. Every time we get more than a couple meters apart, Mahrosh can't breathe." He paused, waiting for her reaction.

There was a brief silence, then a soft, incredulous laugh. "You're serious, aren't you?" she said, her tone switching from amusement to concern.

"Dead serious," he replied, casting a glance at Mahrosh, who was clutching her arms tightly, avoiding his gaze. "I can't leave her alone, not until we figure this out. I wanted to know if... well, if you'd mind if she stayed with us tonight."

To his relief, his wife's response was immediate and understanding. "Of course, Saim. Bring her. This sounds terrifying, and I'm sure she must be shaken up."

Saim felt a weight lift off his shoulders. "Thank you, really. I knew you'd understand."

His wife chuckled, her voice full of warmth. "I've heard of some strange things, but this... let's just say you'll have to tell me everything."

As he hung up, he looked at Mahrosh, who gave him a weak smile. "Your wife... she's okay with this?"

"Yeah, she is," he said, feeling a sense of calm for the first time that evening. "She'll help us figure this out too."

Mahrosh texted her father, "I am staying at my friends home... I will be back home tomorrow." She lied, but it seems to be the only way for her. She can't just say, "I am spending a night with a boy." 

They left the college together, the looming presence of the cursed painting still weighing on their minds. Mahrosh kept close as they walked, still tense from their shared ordeal. By the time they arrived at Saim's apartment, the fatigue of the night was settling over them, a strange heaviness as they prepared to face the unknown.

# The Time Together

The two of them entered the house. Each of them with a tension on their face for what could happen, or what could be the reaction of Aisha. But the things turned different. 

Saim's wife, Aisha, greeted them at the door with a warm smile, pulling Mahrosh into a gentle hug. "You're safe here," she reassured her. "Whatever's going on, we'll figure it out together."

Mahrosh felt a surge of gratitude, her fear momentarily easing. She wasn't alone. Together, they would face whatever darkness lay ahead, and somehow, they would find a way to break free of the curse.

---

In the dimly lit dining room, the three of them sat in silence, the weight of the curse pressing down on them. Mahrosh absently traced a finger around the rim of her glass, her mind racing. Saim's wife, Aisha, studied Mahrosh with a gentle, thoughtful gaze, doing her best to appear unruffled by the strange predicament they had found themselves in.

Finally, Mahrosh broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. “Why am I the only one having trouble breathing?”

Aisha leaned back, glancing thoughtfully between Mahrosh and Saim. “It’s strange, definitely,” she agreed, “but maybe there’s a reason for it… perhaps it’s something to do with gender?”

Saim raised an eyebrow, exchanging a puzzled look with Mahrosh. “Gender?” he repeated, uncertain. “How could that make a difference?”

Aisha hesitated, organizing her thoughts. “Think about it,” she explained slowly, “if the curse binds based on a need for connection, maybe it manifests differently depending on who the connection is with. If Mahrosh were tethered to another woman, maybe they’d both feel the same symptoms, like the suffocation. But with you—”

“You’re saying that the curse affects us differently because he’s a man?” Mahrosh finished, her eyes widening. “So that’s why I’m suffocating, but Saim’s not.”

“Possibly,” Aisha nodded. “I’ve read about curses in folklore that affect people differently, depending on things like family ties, gender, or even specific fears or vulnerabilities.” She paused, glancing at Saim. “And it doesn’t necessarily mean the same effects for each person.”

Saim shook his head, frowning as he tried to piece it together. “So the curse is trying to keep us close—specifically close enough for Mahrosh not to feel that… suffocation. And since we’re not bound in the same way, she’s the one suffering if we’re too far apart.”

A silence fell over the room as the implications of Aisha’s theory settled in. Mahrosh’s hands began to shake slightly, and she clenched them tightly together to steady herself. “So, what do we do?” she whispered, glancing up at Saim and Aisha. “If this curse is tied to gender, how do we break it?”

Aisha considered this, her face calm but eyes sharp with determination. “There might be a way. If it is gender-based, we need to test whether the curse behaves the same way with someone else—a woman who hasn’t yet touched the painting.” She looked at Mahrosh with a hint of hesitation. “Someone you trust, who could potentially take Saim’s place, even just to understand the curse’s boundaries.”

Mahrosh’s eyes widened in alarm. “You’re suggesting that I… ask another woman to touch it?” The very thought sent a chill down her spine.

“I know it sounds risky,” Aisha said softly, “but we need answers. And if it means we can lessen your suffering… it might be worth trying.”

The room fell into tense silence as Mahrosh, Saim, and Aisha weighed the decision ahead. The path forward was uncertain, and whatever lay beyond it would demand even more courage and trust than they had shown so far.

Saim’s face darkened as he absorbed Aisha’s suggestion, his jaw clenching. “Absolutely not,” he said firmly, his tone leaving no room for debate. “First, the painting won’t even be there anymore. It was a temporary display for the exhibition, so there’s no chance of anyone else touching it. And second,” he added, his eyes narrowing as he looked from Aisha to Mahrosh, “I won’t allow anyone—Mahrosh, you, or anyone else—to go near that cursed thing. It’s dangerous. We’ll find another way to break this curse.”

Mahrosh sighed, feeling the tension in the room grow thick enough to cut through. She appreciated Saim’s protectiveness, but there was a stubborn streak in his voice that made the situation feel all the more hopeless. Aisha pressed her lips together, giving her husband a sidelong look but not pushing the issue further.

Sensing the growing heaviness of the conversation, Saim leaned back in his chair, suddenly flashing a mischievous grin. “Alright, Mahrosh,” he said, crossing his arms with an exaggeratedly relaxed air, “since I’ve risked my life—on multiple occasions now—trying to keep you alive, I think it’s time you paid me back.”

Mahrosh’s eyebrows shot up, her anxiety momentarily pushed aside by surprise. “What?”

“Tea,” he said, with a smug smile. “A nice, steaming cup. Oh, and don’t forget to press my shoulders. My muscles are all sore from chasing after you.” He raised an eyebrow, clearly trying to lighten the mood. “If you disobey, just saying, I might decide to test the curse myself… by running right out the door.”

Mahrosh gaped at him, caught between exasperation and a reluctant smile. “Saim, that’s not fair!”

“Hey, we all have to make sacrifices,” he replied, smirking. “Now, tea—and maybe a little shoulder massage, if you please.” He leaned forward, pretending to stretch his legs toward the door. “Or I might just make a break for it.”

Aisha let out a surprised laugh, shaking her head. “Saim, really?” she teased, clearly amused. “You’re blackmailing her into making tea?”

“Not just tea,” he corrected, grinning wider. “Tea with a side of obedience.” He leaned back, winking at Mahrosh. “Now get to it before I change my mind.”

Mahrosh rolled her eyes, feigning annoyance but feeling a smile tugging at her lips as she stood up, moving toward the kitchen. “Fine, but don’t think this makes you any less cursed,” she muttered. “You’re more cursed than ever.”

As she filled the kettle, the laughter that followed her was warm and genuine, softening the edges of the grim reality they all faced.

# The Solution

The next morning, the gravity of their situation weighed heavily as Saim and Mahrosh walked towards Professor Ahmed's office. The campus was bustling with the usual activity, but for them, it felt like they were walking through a fog.

Arriving at the professor's office, Saim knocked gently on the door. "Come in," came the familiar voice, and they stepped inside, the old book clutched tightly in Saim's hand.

Professor Ahmed looked up from his desk, his sharp eyes focused on the duo. "You two seem to have had quite a night," he remarked, motioning for them to sit. "Let's see this book you mentioned."

Saim handed over the book, and the professor began to leaf through it with practiced ease. As he scanned the ancient text, his brow furrowed in concentration. After a long moment, he looked up, his expression serious.

"This is not a simple curse," he began. "It is deeply rooted in ancient rituals and requires more than just a quick fix. However, there is mention of a way to temporarily alleviate the symptoms." He paused, making sure they were following. "To store energy."

Mahrosh and Saim exchanged puzzled looks. "Store energy?" Mahrosh repeated.

Professor Ahmed nodded. "The book suggests that physical touch can store energy between the cursed individuals. This stored energy can give you temporary relief from the curse's effects."

"How does it work?" Saim asked, his curiosity piqued.

"According to the text, engaging in some form of physical contact—holding hands, hugging, or even kissing—for an extended period can store enough energy to keep the curse at bay for a limited time. If you maintain physical contact for about an hour, Mahrosh will have approximately 24 hours of freedom from the curse's effects."

Mahrosh blushed slightly at the thought but nodded. "Alright, if that's what it takes."

Outside the office, Mahrosh and Saim exchanged awkward glances. The idea of physical touch to store energy felt strange and uncomfortable.

"I am not kissing you," Mahrosh declared firmly.

"Neither do I," Saim replied, equally resolute.

With a sigh, Mahrosh extended her left hand and interlocked her fingers with Saim's right hand. "Eww," Saim muttered, but he didn't pull away. Mahrosh used her scarf to tie their hands together, ensuring they wouldn't accidentally separate.

They went about their day, attending classes and completing tasks with their hands bound together. The sight of them holding hands drew curious stares and whispers from their classmates. Many assumed they were a couple deeply in love.

"We are just best friends... and I am married," Saim kept repeating to anyone who asked, but the amused looks and knowing smiles continued.

Despite the awkwardness and the sweatiness of their palms, they managed to store enough energy to give Mahrosh some relief from the curse. As the day went on, they found themselves laughing at the absurdity of their situation, their bond growing stronger with each shared moment.

---

As evening approached, the weight of their circumstances had lessened slightly, replaced by a strange camaraderie. Saim and Mahrosh sat under the sprawling banyan tree on campus, hands still tied with her scarf. The cool breeze offered a small reprieve from the day's suffocating tension.

"Never thought we'd end up like this," Saim mused, half-laughing as he looked at their interlocked hands. "Bound together, literally."

Mahrosh smirked, though her gaze wandered to the horizon, thoughtful. "At least we're figuring it out, right? One awkward step at a time."

Saim nodded. "Yeah, but... what about tomorrow? Or the day after? We can't keep doing this forever." His voice dropped slightly. "I have a wife, Mahrosh. This... whatever it is... can't last."

Mahrosh's chest tightened at his words. Not because of the curse, but because of the unspoken truth hanging between them: they were running out of options.

"You think Professor Ahmed will find a permanent solution?" she asked, her voice tinged with hope.

"He has to," Saim replied. "Until then, we'll manage. Together."

The boundaries they had discovered earlier still held, but at least for now, she could function independently.

# Back Home  

Mahrosh finally reached home, the warm glow of the porch light offering a false sense of comfort. Steeling herself, she stepped inside, only to find the living room steeped in an unsettling silence. Her Amma and Abba sat on the sofa, their faces taut with unspoken emotions. The muted hum of the ceiling fan was the only sound, and it grated against Mahrosh's nerves.  

She hesitated, her fingers gripping the edge of the door as it clicked shut behind her. "Asalamualaikum," she greeted softly, her voice breaking the stillness.  

Her Amma replied curtly, not meeting her eyes. "Walaikum Salam." Her tone carried the weight of disappointment.  

Mahrosh's heart sank, and she turned toward the kitchen, hoping for some clarity. There, she found her elder sister Rabia, chopping vegetables with deliberate force, her movements sharp and purposeful.  

"Rabia," Mahrosh asked cautiously, "what's going on? Did something happen?"  

Rabia glanced up, her expression a mix of concern and irritation. She hesitated before setting the knife down. "Ali told them," she said flatly.  

Mahrosh frowned, confused. "Ali? Told them what?"  

Rabia sighed, folding her arms. "That you were with a boy. He saw you and Saim together on campus."  

Mahrosh froze, her breath catching. "But Saim is just my best friend!" she protested, her voice rising in disbelief. "And he's married!"  

Rabia shrugged, her tone edged with resignation. "You know how Amma and Abba think. They don't care if he's married or not. They only care how it looks to other people. And now they're upset because it looks bad."  

Fuming, Mahrosh stormed into the living room, her anger simmering just below the surface. "Amma, Abba, I didn't do anything wrong," she said, her voice trembling with emotion. "Saim is my friend, and that's all. You can't assume the worst just because someone saw us together."  

Her father, who had been silent, finally looked up, his tone low and measured. "We're not saying you did anything wrong, Mahrosh. But you need to understand how people talk. It's about our family's reputation. We can't afford to give anyone reason to gossip."  

Mahrosh bit her lip, trying to contain the anger threatening to spill over. "I won't stop being friends with him," she said firmly. "He's helped me through so much, and I'm not going to let baseless assumptions ruin that."  

Her mother sighed, her expression softening slightly. "Just... be careful," she murmured. "That's all we ask."  

Before Mahrosh could respond, the sound of a chair scraping against the floor caught her attention. Ali, her cousin, stepped out from the adjacent room. His smug expression made her blood boil.  

"You should be thankful I told them," Ali said, his voice laced with self-righteousness. "I'm just looking out for you. Someone needed to stop you from making a fool of yourself."  

Mahrosh turned on him, her eyes blazing. "Who the hell are you to decide what I do with my life?" she snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through the tension.  

Ali flinched but quickly recovered, crossing his arms. "I'm family, Mahrosh. It's my responsibility to make sure you don't ruin our name..."  

"Ruin our name?" Mahrosh interrupted, her voice trembling with fury. "By what? Having a friend? You don't get to control me or dictate my choices. You're not some moral authority, Ali, so stay out of my life."  

Ali's face darkened, but he stayed silent, sensing that any retort would only escalate the situation.  

"Next time," Mahrosh continued, her voice icy yet trembling, "keep your judgments and gossip to yourself. You've done enough damage already."  

Her words hung in the air like shards of glass, sharp and cutting. Ali stiffened, his mouth opening as if to retort, but the fire in her eyes silenced him. The room seemed to shrink under the weight of her anger, every breath taut with tension.  

Without waiting for a reply, Mahrosh turned on her heel, her fists clenched tightly at her sides. Her footsteps pounded up the stairs, each step echoing her frustration and hurt. She stormed into her room, slamming the door behind her with a force that rattled the walls.  

Once inside, her defiance crumbled. The air felt thick, and her chest heaved as tears began to fall, hot and unrelenting. She staggered to her bed, collapsing onto it as the sobs broke free. The emotions she had fought to keep at bay now overwhelmed her, a tempest of anger, humiliation, and exhaustion.  

She buried her face in her pillow, muffling the sounds of her cries. Her shoulders shook as she let the tears soak through the fabric, the reality of the confrontation cutting deeper than she'd expected. The weight of her family's expectations pressed down on her like an anchor, their voices still echoing in her mind.  

But beneath the heartbreak, a flicker of defiance burned, stubborn and unyielding. Through the tears, Mahrosh whispered to herself, her voice raw but determined, "They don't get to control me. Not Ali. Not anyone."  

The room felt cold and still, but that single spark within her refused to be extinguished. Even as she cried, Mahrosh knew she wouldn't let their judgment define her. She would face this, just as she always had... with strength forged from the fire of her struggles.
