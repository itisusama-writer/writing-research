### Chapter 16: **The Heat Within**  

Saim and Mahrosh sat under the shadow of a towering banyan tree at the far end of campus, their shared tension tangible. The injection kit sat between them, its sterile contents a grim reminder of the lengths they had to go to survive another day.  

"We'll do this again," Saim said, his tone flat as he swabbed his arm with alcohol. "Just to be safe."  

Mahrosh nodded, her gaze fixed on the horizon. "I can’t risk another incident," she murmured.  

Saim extracted a small amount of blood into the syringe, his movements practiced but hesitant. He handed the filled syringe to Mahrosh, who rolled up her sleeve without protest. The sting was brief, but the weight of what they were doing lingered as she leaned back against the tree.  

"That should hold us for another week," Saim said, capping the syringe. His voice carried little relief. "We’ll call Usama tomorrow and figure out our next steps."  

Mahrosh exhaled deeply, her exhaustion evident. "Let’s hope there’s still a next step to take."

The ride home was a blur for Mahrosh, her body drained and her mind heavy with unanswered questions. By the time she stepped inside, the familiar warmth of her house felt oppressive. The air seemed thicker, the walls closer.  

She climbed the stairs slowly, each step an effort. Once in her room, she shut the door firmly and leaned against it, sliding to the floor. Her breathing was steady, but her skin felt like it was on fire.  

The heat was unbearable. She stripped off her clothes, leaving only her undergarments, and lay flat on her bed. Her hair clung to her forehead, damp with sweat, and her sheets grew wet beneath her.  

"What’s happening to me?" she whispered, staring at the ceiling as beads of sweat rolled down her temples.  

Her back ached, the pain dull at first but growing sharper, like claws raking down her spine. She clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms as the pain spread, searing and relentless.  

She turned onto her stomach, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her trembling hand reached back instinctively, fingers brushing against her bare skin.  

The mark.  

It pulsed beneath her touch, a faint heat emanating from it as though it were alive. Her fingers trembled as she traced its edges, the intricate curves and sharp points sending a shiver down her spine.  

And then she felt it—a pull.  

Not physical, but something deeper, something primal. It was as if the mark were a doorway, and something on the other side was trying to claw its way through.  

"No," she gasped, gripping the edge of the mattress as the pain intensified. Her vision blurred, the room spinning as she bit down on her lip to keep from screaming.  

The air around her seemed to ripple, and for a brief moment, she swore she saw a shadow move across her ceiling.  

The Old Lady.  

Her face, her dark, penetrating eyes, flashed in Mahrosh’s mind, clearer than ever before. It wasn’t just a memory—it felt real, as if the Old Lady were standing right behind her, whispering in a language Mahrosh couldn’t understand.  

Her body convulsed, the mark burning like a brand, and she cried out, tears streaming down her face.  

And then, as suddenly as it began, the pain stopped.  

Mahrosh lay motionless, her body slick with sweat and trembling. She turned her head slowly, her gaze falling on the mirror across the room.  

Her reflection stared back at her, but the eyes were wrong.  

They weren’t hers.  

They were dark, empty, and unrelenting—the eyes of the Old Lady.  

Mahrosh screamed, pulling the sheets around her as she scrambled backward against the headboard. The reflection remained unchanged, its cold gaze piercing through her.  

The door burst open, and Rabia rushed in, her face pale with worry. "Mahrosh! What’s going on?"  

Mahrosh pointed a shaking hand at the mirror. "The mirror... it’s her! She’s in there!"  

Rabia turned to the mirror, her expression confused. "Mahrosh, there’s nothing there. It’s just you."  

Mahrosh’s breath hitched as she looked again. The eyes were hers once more, bloodshot and wide with terror.  

Rabia stepped closer, sitting on the edge of the bed. "You’re scaring me. What’s happening to you?"  

Mahrosh buried her face in her hands, her voice trembling. "She’s... she’s inside me. I can feel her."  

Rabia hesitated before stepping closer, her brows furrowed as she looked down at Mahrosh. "You’re burning up," she murmured, placing a hand on Mahrosh’s shoulder. The sweat didn’t seem to cling to her hand the way it drenched Mahrosh’s skin.

"Why aren’t you...?" Mahrosh whispered, her voice breaking.

Rabia frowned. "What?"

Mahrosh shook her head, pulling away slightly. "Why aren’t you sweating? It’s so hot in here... isn’t it?"

Rabia blinked, confused. "Mahrosh, it’s not hot. The room feels normal."

A cold wave of realization swept over Mahrosh, cutting through the oppressive heat she felt. It wasn’t the room. It was her.

The Old Lady wasn’t just near. She was inside.
