# Boundaries Tested

Mahrosh and Saim decided they needed to understand what was happening. They found a quiet spot within the university to test the curse again.

"Let's see if it happens here too," Saim suggested, his voice shaky but determined.

Mahrosh nodded. They cautiously took small steps away from each other, counting the distance. When they reached about two meters apart, Mahrosh felt the tightness in her chest return, while Saim felt nothing unusual.

"Are you feeling it?" Saim asked, his eyes wide with concern.

"Yes," Mahrosh replied, gasping slightly. "It's just like before."

They stepped back closer, and the symptoms faded. They exchanged worried looks, realizing this wasn't just a coincidence.

"We can't ignore this, Saim," Mahrosh said, her voice trembling. "Something is definitely keeping us tied together."

Saim nodded, still trying to process everything. "Yeah, but what can we do about it? It's not like we can just undo a curse."

Mahrosh sighed, feeling the weight of the situation. "I don't know. But we have to accept that we're stuck together for now. Whatever this is, it's real."

Saim looked at the dark mark on his wrist and then back at Mahrosh. "I guess we just have to figure out how to deal with it until we can find a solution."

"Saim... We need to be together. We are stuck." Mahrosh said in disblief. She was scared, her mind was not ready to accept their strange bond

As the unsettling reality of their situation dawned on them, Saim took a step back, scratching his head in disbelief.

"Mahrosh, I... can't be here like this. You know I'm married," he said, voice laced with frustration and concern. "Staying with you like this - it's going to create problems."

Mahrosh's heart sank as the enormity of the situation hit her. She looked away, her face growing pale. "But... what am I supposed to do?" she whispered. "I can't breathe when you're not close. It's like... it's like I'm being strangled from the inside." Her voice broke slightly, betraying her fear.

Saim shook his head, his gaze darting around as if searching for answers. "There has to be a way to break this... connection. Maybe it's just temporary. Maybe it fades after a while."

They stood in silence, the weight of the situation pressing down on them both. The only sounds were their own breaths and the distant hum of students still lingering near the exhibition hall. Finally, Saim spoke up, his voice low.

"Look," he said, "I'll try to find a way around this without... causing issues with my wife. But Mahrosh, if this curse or whatever it is doesn't break soon, we'll have to find another solution."

Mahrosh's eyes lit up with an idea. "Wait, I remember a book," she said. "There was an old book displayed next to the cursed painting. It might have some information about this."

Saim's interest was piqued. "Do you think it could help us?" he asked, hope creeping into his voice.

"It's worth a shot," Mahrosh replied, determination replacing her fear. "Let's go back and check it out."

Without a second thought, she turned and sprinted toward the exhibition hall, barely registering Saim's shout as she broke the invisible two-meter boundary. The tightness gripped her chest, each step harder than the last. She stumbled, wheezing, and stopped, clutching her throat as panic flooded her.

Saim quickly caught up, his face etched with worry. "Mahrosh, are you insane? You can't just..." He cut himself off, realizing her desperation. He took her arm, steadying her.

Saim glanced back toward the exhibition hall and nodded. Together, they hurried back through the quieting corridors, feeling the weight of curious eyes as they slipped past lingering students and faculty. Finally, they reached the painting, the old woman's eyes seeming to watch them with silent amusement.

There, lying just off to the side on a small, dark wooden stand, was the book. Saim picked it up gingerly, and they examined it together, the leather cover worn and embossed with intricate designs. As they opened it, Mahrosh's heart sank. The script was unfamiliar, flowing in elaborate, unreadable patterns.

"It's... Arabic, I think," Saim murmured, his brow furrowing. "But we don't have a clue what any of this means."

"Maybe... someone else does." Mahrosh scanned the hall, her gaze landing on Professor Ahmed, a linguistics instructor known for his knowledge of ancient languages. She didn't hesitate, pulling Saim along as they approached him.

"Sir!" Mahrosh called out, and Professor Ahmed turned, eyebrows raised as he noticed the book in Saim's hands.

"Young lady, where did you find that?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.

"By the painting," Mahrosh explained breathlessly. "We think... we think it might have something to do with what's happening to us."

Professor Ahmed looked from her to Saim, as if weighing the seriousness of their request. Finally, he nodded. "Bring it by my office tomorrow," he said. "If there's anything in here about that painting's... effects, I'll do my best to find it."

Mahrosh exhaled, feeling a flicker of hope. "Thank you, sir. We'll be here first thing."

As they turned to leave, she and Saim exchanged a look. Tomorrow held no guarantees, but it was a start. And for now, as unsettling as their forced closeness felt, at least they weren't facing it alone.

Saim sighed, glancing at Mahrosh with a mix of frustration and concern. He knew he couldn't leave her, not like this. He took out his phone, hesitating as he dialed his wife's number. The ring felt like it lasted forever, and when she finally answered, her voice was warm and familiar, grounding him amidst all the chaos.

"Hey, Saim," she said brightly, sensing his hesitation. "Everything okay?"

Saim took a breath, trying to gather his thoughts. "Something... strange happened at the exhibition tonight," he began. "Mahrosh and I touched this old painting, and... well, I know this sounds insane, but it's like we're cursed or something. Every time we get more than a couple meters apart, Mahrosh can't breathe." He paused, waiting for her reaction.

There was a brief silence, then a soft, incredulous laugh. "You're serious, aren't you?" she said, her tone switching from amusement to concern.

"Dead serious," he replied, casting a glance at Mahrosh, who was clutching her arms tightly, avoiding his gaze. "I can't leave her alone, not until we figure this out. I wanted to know if... well, if you'd mind if she stayed with us tonight."

To his relief, his wife's response was immediate and understanding. "Of course, Saim. Bring her. This sounds terrifying, and I'm sure she must be shaken up."

Saim felt a weight lift off his shoulders. "Thank you, really. I knew you'd understand."

His wife chuckled, her voice full of warmth. "I've heard of some strange things, but this... let's just say you'll have to tell me everything."

As he hung up, he looked at Mahrosh, who gave him a weak smile. "Your wife... she's okay with this?"

"Yeah, she is," he said, feeling a sense of calm for the first time that evening. "She'll help us figure this out too."

Mahrosh texted her father, "I am staying at my friends home... I will be back home tomorrow." She lied, but it seems to be the only way for her. She can't just say, "I am spending a night with a boy." 

They left the college together, the looming presence of the cursed painting still weighing on their minds. Mahrosh kept close as they walked, still tense from their shared ordeal. By the time they arrived at Saim's apartment, the fatigue of the night was settling over them, a strange heaviness as they prepared to face the unknown.
