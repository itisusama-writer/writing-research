# The Solution

The next morning, the gravity of their situation weighed heavily as Saim and Mahrosh walked towards Professor Ahmed's office. The campus was bustling with the usual activity, but for them, it felt like they were walking through a fog.

Arriving at the professor's office, Saim knocked gently on the door. "Come in," came the familiar voice, and they stepped inside, the old book clutched tightly in Saim's hand.

Professor Ahmed looked up from his desk, his sharp eyes focused on the duo. "You two seem to have had quite a night," he remarked, motioning for them to sit. "Let's see this book you mentioned."

Saim handed over the book, and the professor began to leaf through it with practiced ease. As he scanned the ancient text, his brow furrowed in concentration. After a long moment, he looked up, his expression serious.

"This is not a simple curse," he began. "It is deeply rooted in ancient rituals and requires more than just a quick fix. However, there is mention of a way to temporarily alleviate the symptoms." He paused, making sure they were following. "To store energy."

Mahrosh and Saim exchanged puzzled looks. "Store energy?" Mahrosh repeated.

Professor Ahmed nodded. "The book suggests that physical touch can store energy between the cursed individuals. This stored energy can give you temporary relief from the curse's effects."

"How does it work?" Saim asked, his curiosity piqued.

"According to the text, engaging in some form of physical contact—holding hands, hugging, or even kissing—for an extended period can store enough energy to keep the curse at bay for a limited time. If you maintain physical contact for about an hour, Mahrosh will have approximately 24 hours of freedom from the curse's effects."

Mahrosh blushed slightly at the thought but nodded. "Alright, if that's what it takes."

Outside the office, Mahrosh and Saim exchanged awkward glances. The idea of physical touch to store energy felt strange and uncomfortable.

"I am not kissing you," Mahrosh declared firmly.

"Neither do I," Saim replied, equally resolute.

With a sigh, Mahrosh extended her left hand and interlocked her fingers with Saim's right hand. "Eww," Saim muttered, but he didn't pull away. Mahrosh used her scarf to tie their hands together, ensuring they wouldn't accidentally separate.

They went about their day, attending classes and completing tasks with their hands bound together. The sight of them holding hands drew curious stares and whispers from their classmates. Many assumed they were a couple deeply in love.

"We are just best friends... and I am married," Saim kept repeating to anyone who asked, but the amused looks and knowing smiles continued.

Despite the awkwardness and the sweatiness of their palms, they managed to store enough energy to give Mahrosh some relief from the curse. As the day went on, they found themselves laughing at the absurdity of their situation, their bond growing stronger with each shared moment.

As evening approached, the weight of their circumstances had lessened slightly, replaced by a strange camaraderie. Saim and Mahrosh sat under the sprawling banyan tree on campus, hands still tied with her scarf. The cool breeze offered a small reprieve from the day's suffocating tension.

"Never thought we'd end up like this," Saim mused, half-laughing as he looked at their interlocked hands. "Bound together, literally."

Mahrosh smirked, though her gaze wandered to the horizon, thoughtful. "At least we're figuring it out, right? One awkward step at a time."

Saim nodded. "Yeah, but... what about tomorrow? Or the day after? We can't keep doing this forever." His voice dropped slightly. "I have a wife, Mahrosh. This... whatever it is... can't last."

Mahrosh's chest tightened at his words. Not because of the curse, but because of the unspoken truth hanging between them: they were running out of options.

"You think Professor Ahmed will find a permanent solution?" she asked, her voice tinged with hope.

"He has to," Saim replied. "Until then, we'll manage. Together."

The boundaries they had discovered earlier still held, but at least for now, she could function independently.
