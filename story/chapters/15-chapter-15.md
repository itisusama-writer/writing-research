### Chapter 15: **Unseen Shadows**  

The classroom felt suffocating, the air heavy with a stillness that pressed on Mahrosh's chest. She sat at her desk near the window, the sunlight streaming in doing little to chase away the damp chill that had taken root in her. Her scarf clung to her skin, slick with sweat, and her trembling hands fidgeted with the edge of her notebook.  

Every creak of the door sent her pulse racing until finally, Saim walked in. His sharp eyes scanned the room before landing on her, his expression darkening the moment he saw her pale face.  

"Mahrosh, what's wrong?" he asked, striding across the room to sit beside her. His voice was firm but carried an edge of worry.  

She hesitated, glancing at the other students around them. "I... I'm not okay," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. She leaned in, her eyes darting nervously. "Something new. There's a mark, Saim. On my back."  

Saim's jaw tightened as he leaned closer, their shoulders brushing. "What kind of mark?"  

Mahrosh swallowed hard, her fingers gripping the edge of her desk. "Rabia saw it this morning. She said it's intricate... like a symbol. I didn't even know it was there."  

His brows furrowed, and he leaned forward, lowering his voice further. "Did you take a picture of it? Can I see it?"  

Her cheeks flushed at the thought, and she shook her head. "No, I... I couldn't. It feels... too personal."  

Saim sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Mahrosh, this isn't about personal boundaries anymore. If the mark is part of the curse, we need to figure out what it means. You trust me, don't you?"  

His words stung, not because she didn't trust him, but because she trusted him too much. She nodded reluctantly, her heart hammering in her chest. "I do, but I can't show you. There has to be another way."  

He exhaled deeply, his gaze softening as he placed a steadying hand on the desk between them. "Alright. What if you draw it? Sketch out what Rabia described. We can work with that."  

Relieved, Mahrosh nodded. She reached into her bag, pulling out a blank notebook and a pen. Her hands trembled slightly as she started sketching, the memory of Rabia's worried tone echoing in her ears.  

The lines came hesitantly at first, her mind grappling with the image Rabia had described. Slowly, the swirling curves and sharp edges began to take shape. The pattern wasn't perfect. She hadn't seen it herself, but it carried an eerie elegance, a beauty that unsettled her as much as it intrigued her.  

When she finished, she slid the notebook across the desk to Saim without meeting his gaze. "This is the best I can do," she murmured.  

Saim picked up the notebook, his eyes scanning the symbol with a growing intensity. "This looks familiar," he muttered, flipping through his own notebook. He stopped on a page filled with hastily drawn symbols Usama had shown them during one of their meetings.  

Mahrosh leaned closer, her breath catching as she saw the resemblance. "It's similar, isn't it?"  

"It's a binding mark," Saim said, his voice grim. "Usama mentioned these before. They're used in curses to anchor a connection... like a signature of the entity involved."  

Her stomach churned, dread pooling low in her chest. "So, the Old Lady is... marking me as hers?"  

Saim's silence spoke louder than any words could. His lips pressed into a thin line as he finally met her gaze. "We need to show this to Usama. Immediately."  

Mahrosh nodded, but unease gnawed at her. The mark wasn't just a symbol, it was a claim, a brand of possession that the curse was tightening its grip.  

She clenched her fists, her voice barely steady. "What if... what if this means it's too late? What if she's already winning?"  

Saim placed a hand on her shoulder, grounding her with his steady presence. "She hasn't won yet," he said firmly. "And as long as we're fighting, she never will."  

But even as he spoke the words, they both felt the creeping shadow of doubt. Time was slipping through their fingers, and the Old Lady's grip was stronger than ever.
