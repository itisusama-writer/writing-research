# A Terrifying Discovery

It was next afternoon, Mahrosh and Saim sat huddled over a laptop in the quietest corner of the university library, their faces illuminated by the pale glow of the screen. They had stumbled upon a website https://itisusama-writer.github.io/fake-articles/. A local website, claiming to host rare academic papers and personal accounts about paranormal phenomena. With trembling fingers, Mahrosh clicked on an article titled "The Haunted Portrait: Paris Exhibition's Mysterious Attraction." As they read, the weight of the curse grew heavier with every line. The painting, it turned out, had a dark history of ensnaring individuals.

However, it was a one of the article, "The Roll Number Curse - Masooma Zehra's Haunting Experience." that left them breathless. The story detailed the experience of an NCA student named Masooma Zehra, who had endured a similar curse with her sister, tethered together by a bond they couldn't escape. As Mahrosh read further, a chilling realization dawned: Masooma's roll number matched hers exactly, suggesting that it might be the continuing of a cycle connected to the painting.

Saim leaned back, running a hand through his hair. "This is bigger than us," he muttered. "If Masooma went through the same thing, we need to find her."

"And not just her," Mahrosh added, her voice shaking. "The article mentions a demonologist...Usama, who specializes in curses like this. If anyone can help us figure out what's happening, it's him."

Their search had given them two names, two potential lifelines. Now, all they had to do was find them.

Saim and Mahrosh wasted no time. They approached the administration office at NCA, carefully crafting a story about needing to contact Masooma Zehra for a research project. After some initial hesitation, the staff agreed to check their records.

"You're in luck," the administrator said, handing them a slip of paper. "We still have her contact information from her graduation year."

Mahrosh's heart raced as she copied down the number. "Thank you," she said quickly, clutching the paper tightly as they left the office.

Outside, they found a quiet bench under the shade of a tree. Mahrosh stared at the number for a moment before dialing it, her fingers trembling slightly. She pressed the phone to her ear, Saim sitting beside her with a look of cautious anticipation.

The line clicked, and a soft, slightly wary voice answered. "Hello?"

"Hi, is this Masooma Zehra?" Mahrosh asked, her voice steady despite the knot in her stomach.

"Yes, who's this?" Masooma's tone was polite but guarded.

"I'm Mahrosh Javaid, a student at NCA," she began. "I came across your name in an article... about the painting."

There was a pause on the other end, followed by a sharp intake of breath. "The painting?" Masooma repeated, her voice now tinged with tension.

"Yes," Mahrosh confirmed. "I think... I think I'm going through what you went through. The suffocation, the bond... everything."

Another pause. "Where are you right now?" Masooma finally asked, her voice quieter.

"At the university," Mahrosh replied. "Please, we need your help. Can you tell us how you managed?"

Masooma sighed, her voice softening. "I'll try. What do you want to know?"

"Do you have a mark?" Saim interjected, leaning closer to the phone. "On your wrist, like a bruise or... anything unusual?"

"No," Masooma replied immediately. "Neither I nor my sister ever had any physical marks. It was just... the suffocation. And the bond."

"How did you survive it?" Mahrosh asked, her voice cracking slightly.

"It's not hard for us," Masooma admitted. "We're sisters. We've always lived together, so staying within two meters isn't a problem. It's just how our lives are now."

Mahrosh exchanged a glance with Saim, her chest tightening. "So you never tried to break it?"

Masooma hesitated. "We did... once. But the consequences were worse than the curse itself. You don't want to go down that road."

"What do you mean?" Saim asked urgently.

Masooma's voice dropped, the weight of her words palpable even over the phone. "There's no way to break the curse, not without paying a price... one that's too high. Death... that's the only escape."

The line went silent for a moment before Masooma continued, her tone shifting slightly. "But if you're looking for a way to make it easier, to store energy faster... Usama can help. He's a demonologist. He helped me and my sister. He can teach you how to manage the curse, but breaking it? That's not something he'll promise."

"Where can we find him?" Mahrosh asked, gripping the phone tightly.

"I'll send you his contact," Masooma replied. "Just be prepared. He'll help you survive, but you won't like everything he has to say."

Before Mahrosh could ask more, the line went dead. She lowered the phone slowly, her knuckles white as she gripped it.

"What did she mean, 'you won't like what he has to say'?" Mahrosh murmured, more to herself than to Saim.

"What the hell this Usama is going to say?..." Marosh whispered to herself, expression of anger on her face.

Saim leaned back, his jaw tight. "I don't know, but if this is the only way forward, we don't have a choice."

The words hung between them, heavy and foreboding, as if the curse itself was listening.
