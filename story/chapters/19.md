# Chapter 19: The Old Lady’s Wrath

And the… tension thickened, the rooms’s walls seeming to close in as if drawn by an invisible force. The whispers grew louder. Words in a language neither Saim nor Mahrosh could understand. They stood frozen, the Old Lady’s gaze burning into their very souls from the shadows they both saw.

“Saim,” Mahrosh whispered, clutching his arm tightly. “I can’t move. I…” Her voice faltered as a shiver ran down her spine, her chest tightening like a vice.

Before Saim could react, the room’s lights flickered wildly and went dim. A cold wind blew through the house, and faint, chilling laughter echoed—it was the Old Lady. Her shadowy eyes glowed faintly, and at that moment, it was clear—she was no longer confined to the canvas.

The shadow stretched from its normal size, crawling across the floor like a living entity. It slithered toward them, growing larger and more defined with each passing second. The shadow coalesced into the form of the Old Lady, her spectral figure looming over the pair. Her face twisted with malice as her skeletal hand reached out.

“You dare defy me?” her voice hissed, the sound cutting through the air like a dagger. “Your bond is mine to control.”

Saim instinctively stepped in front of Mahrosh, shielding her as best as he could. “Leave her alone!” he shouted, his voice cracking with both fear and determination.

The Old Lady’s laugh surrounds the room, her expression one of twisted amusement. “Such bravery,” she mocked, “but futile. You are bound by my curse. You will suffer together or perish apart.”

Without warning, her hand lashed out, striking Saim in the chest. He was thrown backward, crashing into a display case with a sickening thud. Glass shattered around him, and he groaned in pain, struggling to rise.

“Saim!” Mahrosh cried, rushing toward him, but the Old Lady’s shadow blocked her path. Tendrils of darkness coiled around her wrists and ankles, dragging her to her knees.

The suffocating sensation returned with a vengeance, and Mahrosh gasped for air. Her vision blurred, and her heartbeat pounded in her ears. The Old Lady loomed closer, her skeletal fingers reaching for Mahrosh’s face.

“You are mine,” she hissed, her voice dripping with malice. “Your defiance ends now.”

Mahrosh closed her eyes, bracing for the inevitable. But just as the Old Lady’s fingers brushed her skin, a burst of light erupted from the doorway.

Mahrosh’s family burst into the room. The door slams open and it disrupts the dark energy filling the space. Her father stood at the forefront, clutching a diary tightly in his hands, his face pale but resolute.

“Saim!” Mahrosh’s mother screamed, rushing to his side where he lay sprawled on the floor, groaning in pain.

Mahrosh’s father wasted no time. He began reciting verses from the Quran aloud, his voice steady and commanding. The Arabic words echoed through the room, clashing with the sinister whispers of the Old Lady.

The Old Lady’s form recoiled, her shadowy tendrils trembling as if in agony. Her glowing eyes flickered, the malevolent light within them dimming.

“No!” she shrieked, her voice rising to a deafening pitch. “You cannot banish me!”

The recitation grew louder, each word striking the darkness like a hammer. Mahrosh gasped for air, the suffocating weight on her chest easing with every verse. Her mother cradled her as tears streamed down her face.

The Old Lady’s form began to dissolve, her shadowy figure breaking apart into wisps of smoke. With one final, piercing scream, she vanished completely, leaving behind only the oppressive silence of the room.

Mahrosh’s father lowered the Quran, his hands trembling slightly. He turned to his daughter, his eyes filled with both relief and fear. “Are you alright?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Mahrosh nodded weakly, her breathing still shallow but steadier. “She’s gone,” she managed to say, her voice trembling.

Saim groaned, attempting to sit up. “Is everyone okay?” he asked, his voice hoarse.

Mahrosh’s father helped him to his feet, his expression softening. “You both are safe now,” he said. “But this… this isn’t over.”

The room remained heavy with the memory of what had just transpired. Though the Old Lady was gone, her presence lingered like a shadow, a reminder of the danger that still loomed.
