# Chapter 10: **The First Injection**  

They ride back from the Pak Tea House in silence. Mahrosh kept staring at Saim, who was gripping the handles of the bike tighter than usual. The suggestion of injecting blood lingered heavily between them, but neither had the energy to discuss further.  

When they reached NCA, Mahrosh hesitated at the enter, unsure if she should step inside. Saim gave her a reassuring nod. "Everthing will be fine," he said softly. "we have to do this. Let's get this over with before it's too late. You have to go back home on time."  

The two made their way to the park, where Saim started unpacking his bag. Inside were syringes, sterile gloves, and small glass vials which he bought on their way back to NCA. Everything looked unsettlingly professional, yet the sight of it sent a chill down Mahrosh's spine.  

"Sit down," Saim instructed. "Saim, roll up your sleeve."  

Saim hesitated for a moment, his jaw tightening. "Are you sure about this?" He gave Mahrosh a look. "It's not going to harm you, and it will stabilize you for a week. as Usama said. But remember, this is just a temporary solution. We have to do this every week."  

Mahrosh watched Saim reluctantly roll up his sleeve, exposing his arm. And tied a rubber band around it, finding a vein with practiced ease. The syringe glinted under the dim light, and Mahrosh's breath hitched.  

"Are you okay?" Saim asked, glancing at her.  

She nodded, though her hands trembled slightly. "I'm fine. Just... let's get it over with."  

The needle pierced Saim's skin, and blood filled the syringe, slightly more than 1mm. Saim winced but said nothing, keeping his eyes on Mahrosh. Once the blood was extracted, Saim turned to her.  

"Your turn," He said.  

Mahrosh froze for a moment, her heart racing. She had agreed to this, but now, as Saim approached with the syringe, panic bubbled up inside her.  

"You can do this," Saim said, his voice steady. "We've come this far."  

Taking a deep breath, Mahrosh extended her arm. Saim swabbed the area, then injected the blood into her vein. The sharp sting lasted only a moment, but the weight of what they had done settled over the room like a thick fog.  

"It's done," Saim said. Both looked at each other and smiled.  

Mahrosh sat back, her head spinning slightly. "I feel... normal," she said, her voice uncertain.  

"You will," Saim replied. "The blood will mimic the bond, allowing your body to absorb the energy it craves. But remember... not to push your limits."

Saim sat across from Mahrosh in the on the ground in park, her expression unreadable. A silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.  

"Do you think this will actually work?" Mahrosh finally asked, breaking the quiet.  

"I don't know," Saim admitted. "But at least we have a week to figure out our next move."  

Mahrosh nodded, though her unease remained. "What did Usama talk to you about earlier? When he pulled you aside?"  

Saim hesitated, his jaw clenching. "Nothing important," he said quickly. "Just more warnings about the curse."  

Mahrosh narrowed her eyes, sensing he wasn't telling her everything, but decided not to press him. Instead, she leaned back, exhaustion overtaking her.  

"You should go home... or Ali will think of something stupid." Saim said after a while.  

Mahrosh glanced at him, unsure. "What if something happens while I'm there?"  

Saim exhaled sharply. "You'll be fine for a week now. Just... try to rest. We'll meet tomorrow and plan our next steps."  

Reluctantly, Mahrosh stood, grabbing her bag. "Thanks, Saim," she said softly. "For everything."  

As she left, Saim went straight back to his apartment. Right away he enters the room and sank into the couch, rubbing his temples. Usama's words echoed in his mind: 'Marriage would make this easier'  

For a fleeting moment, he considered it again. But the image of Aisha's trusting face flashed before him, and he pushed the thought away.

Later that night, Aisha returned home. She immediately noticed the tension in Saim's posture as he sat on the couch, staring at nothing.

"Hey," she said, setting her bag down. "Rough day?"

Saim forced a smile, but it didn't reach his eyes. "You could say that."

Aisha frowned, sitting beside him. "Is everything okay with Mahrosh? Did you find a solution?"

"We found something," Saim replied vaguely. "Usama suggested a temporary fix. It'll help for now."

At the mention of Usama's name, Aisha froze, her brow furrowing. "Wait. Usama? As in Usama Hassan?"

Saim blinked, confused. "Yeah... how do you know him?"

Aisha leaned back, a small, wry smile crossing her face. "We used to be classmates back in university. We took Astrology and Mythology together as an extra subject. He was always the one with the craziest theories... half of which turned out to be true. I remember he gave a whole presentation about cursed objects that scared the entire class."

Saim raised an eyebrow. "That sounds like him. He's a demonologist now."

Aisha nodded, her expression growing more serious. "I'm not surprised. He always had a fascination with the paranormal. But be careful with him, Saim. Usama means well, but he's not afraid to walk dangerous paths to find answers."

Saim sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "He suggested injecting my blood into Mahrosh to help stabilize her."

Aisha's eyes widened slightly, though her calm demeanor didn't falter. "And you agreed?"

"I didn't have a choice," Saim admitted. "It's the only thing that'll buy us time while we figure out the rest."

Aisha studied him for a moment, her expression unreadable. Then she reached out, taking his hand. "You're doing the right thing, Saim. Helping her. Just... don't lose yourself in this, okay?"

Her words struck a chord, and Saim nodded silently.

The next day, Mahrosh woke feeling better than she had in weeks. The injection seemed to have worked, giving her a newfound energy. But as she arrived on campus, a strange sensation crept over her.  

The suffocation was gone, but something else lingered... a faint, gnawing emptiness, something different, like she was having mixed up thoughts. She seeing things just like Saim.  

Saim noticed it too when they met later that afternoon. "You seem... off," he said, watching her closely.  

"I feel off," Mahrosh admitted. "It's like... I am becoming you. It seems like I am having two personalities inside of me."  

Saim frowned, his unease growing. "We need to keep a closer eye on this. If it changes again..."  

"Let's hope it doesn't," Mahrosh said, though her voice betrayed her doubt.  

The curse wasn't done with them yet, and they both knew it.
