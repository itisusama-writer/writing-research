Ignoring the cautionary looks from others, Mahrosh and Saim moved closer to the painting. The painting was larger than life, its colors muted but striking. The old woman in the frame seemed to stare directly at them, her eyes glinting as if hiding a secret. A small plaque beneath it read: 'Her Gaze Endures.'

The crowd gave the painting a wide berth, as though afraid to get too close. Whispers drifted through the air, fragments of superstitious murmurs about curses and bad luck.

This whole incident intensifies their curiousity, and now they were more determined then before to capture the horrigying and eerie feeling in high resolution. As they leaned in, the tension around them grew.

"Let's get a close-up," Mahrosh whispered, her voice barely audible over the hushed murmurs of the crowd. She could feel her heart racing with excitement and a bit of fear.

As they got closer, their curiosity peaked. Without thinking, both of them reached out at the same moment. Their fingers brushed against the painting's surface, the surface was unexpectedly rough, almost like cold sandpaper, and the icy jolt felt like it reached into their very bones. Mahrosh gasped as her heart seemed to skip a beat, while Saim's knees buckled slightly. sending an unexpected chill through their bodies. They froze for a second, as if the painting itself was alive and reacting to their touch.

For a brief moment, Mahrosh thought she heard a faint whisper, indistinct yet chilling, as though the painting itself were exhaling a warning. The room seemed to hold its breath, and for a moment, everything was silent.

The lights flickered as the room fell silent. For a second, the old woman's eyes seemed to flash, following their movements.

"Did... did you feel that?" Mahrosh stammered, eyes wide with shock.

Saim nodded, breathless and still reeling from the icy jolt. "We need to get out of here. Now."

They quickly pulled their hands away from the painting, exchanging anxious glances. The tension broke just enough for them to share a nervous laugh, though the fear lingered.

As they made their way through the crowded halls, giggles of relief escaped them, exhilarated by the thrill of their rebellious act. They darted past curious onlookers, not stopping until they were outside.

The cool evening air hit them, refreshing after the stifling atmosphere of the gallery. Mahrosh leaned against a nearby pillar, catching her breath. She looked at Saim and noticed him frowning as he examined his wrist.

"Hey, what's wrong?" she asked, her voice still shaky.

Saim held up his right wrist, revealing a strange, dark mark forming—a faint outline, almost like a bruise, spreading across his skin in an unfamiliar shape. "I don't know," he murmured, rubbing at it. "It doesn't hurt, but... it's weird."

Mahrosh took a step closer to examine the unusual mark on Saim's wrist, "It looks like a bruise, but... it's so weird," she said, reaching out to touch it.

The mark was dark, almost unnatural, standing out starkly against his skin. They exchanged a tense glance, both uneasy but trying to brush it off.

"Guess we really got what we asked for," Saim joked weakly, attempting to lighten the mood.

Mahrosh forced a smile. "Maybe it's just a weird reaction to the paint or something."

They walked together, trying to shake off the unsettling experience. But as they moved away from each other slightly more 2 meters, a strange sensation settled over Mahrosh. Mahrosh clutched her chest, her breaths coming in shallow gasps as her vision blurred at the edges. Her knees wobbled, and she stumbled, forcing Saim to grab her arm to steady her.

Noticing her discomfort, Saim stepped back toward her, "Mahrosh! Are you okay?" he asked, his voice rising in alarm. Suddenly, she felt normal. They looked at each other, a spark of realization dawning on their faces.

Mahrosh's voice dropped to a whisper, her eyes wide. "What if... this is because of the painting? What if it did something to us?" Her mind raced with possibilities, each more horrifying than the last.

Saim clenched his fists, his voice laced with frustration. "This can’t be real. There has to be a logical explanation—there has to be." But even as he said it, doubt gnawed at the edges of his certainty.

The two cautiously took small steps away from each other, only to find that once they crossed a certain distance, the feeling of suffocation crept back over her, retreating again as Saim stepped back closer.

They exchanged worried looks. Something was definitely wrong, and it seemed that whatever bound them now was more than just a mark on Saim's wrist—it was something far darker, and it kept them tethered in a way neither had anticipated.

As they moved farther from the gallery, a low hum began to resonate in their ears, faint but insistent. Mahrosh glanced back and froze, she could have sworn the old woman in the painting was now smiling.
