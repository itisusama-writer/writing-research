Ignoring the cautionary looks, Mahrosh and Saim edged closer to the painting, preparing to capture the "haunting" in high resolution. As they leaned in, Mahrosh whispered, "Let's get a close-up." Just as they did, both reached out instinctively, their fingers brushing the painting's surface at the same time.

An icy jolt surged through them, sending shivers down their spines. The lights flickered as the room fell silent. For a second, the old woman's eyes seemed to flash, following their movements.

"Did... did you feel that?" Mahrosh stammered, eyes wide.

Saim nodded, breathless. "We need to go. Now."

After brushing their fingers against the painting, Mahrosh and Saim exchanged a nervous laugh, the tension breaking just enough for them to bolt away from the exhibit. Giggling, they slipped through the crowded halls, exhilarated by the thrill of their rebellious act.

Once they were outside, the cool evening air welcomed them, a refreshing contrast to the stifling atmosphere of the gallery. Mahrosh leaned against a nearby pillar, still catching her breath, when she noticed Saim glancing down at his wrist with a frown.

"Hey, what's up?" she asked, still grinning.

Saim held up his right wrist, revealing a strange, dark mark forming—a faint outline, almost like a bruise, spreading across his skin in an unfamiliar shape. "I don't know," he murmured, rubbing at it. "It doesn't hurt, but... it's weird."

Mahrosh took a step closer to examine the unusual mark on Saim's wrist, her curiosity undiminished. The mark was dark, almost unnatural, standing out starkly against his skin. They exchanged a tense glance, both uneasy but trying to brush it off.

"Guess we really got what we asked for," Saim joked weakly, attempting to lighten the mood.

Mahrosh forced a smile. "Maybe it's just a weird reaction to the paint or something."

They walked together, trying to shake off the unsettling experience. But as they moved away from each other slightly more 2 meters, a strange sensation settled over Mahrosh. She started to feel a tightness in her chest and a subtle difficulty in catching her breath.

Noticing her discomfort, Saim stepped back toward her, and just as suddenly, she felt normal. They looked at each other, a spark of realization dawning on their faces.

"Wait," Mahrosh said, "What if...?"

The two cautiously took small steps away from each other, only to find that once they crossed a certain distance, the feeling of suffocation crept back over her, retreating again as Saim stepped back closer.

They exchanged worried looks. Something was definitely wrong, and it seemed that whatever bound them now was more than just a mark on Saim's wrist—it was something far darker, and it kept them tethered in a way neither had anticipated.
