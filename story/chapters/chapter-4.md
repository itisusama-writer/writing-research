# The Time Together

The two of them entered the house. Each of them with a tension on their face for what could happen, or what could be the reaction of Aisha. But the things turned different. 

Saim's wife, Aisha, greeted them at the door with a warm smile, pulling Mahrosh into a gentle hug. "You're safe here," she reassured her. "Whatever's going on, we'll figure it out together."

Mahrosh felt a surge of gratitude, her fear momentarily easing. She wasn't alone. Together, they would face whatever darkness lay ahead, and somehow, they would find a way to break free of the curse.

In the dimly lit dining room, the three of them sat in silence, the weight of the curse pressing down on them. Mahrosh absently traced a finger around the rim of her glass, her mind racing. Saim's wife, Aisha, studied Mahrosh with a gentle, thoughtful gaze, doing her best to appear unruffled by the strange predicament they had found themselves in.

Finally, Mahrosh broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. “Why am I the only one having trouble breathing?”

Aisha leaned back, glancing thoughtfully between Mahrosh and Saim. “It’s strange, definitely,” she agreed, “but maybe there’s a reason for it… perhaps it’s something to do with gender?”

Saim raised an eyebrow, exchanging a puzzled look with Mahrosh. “Gender?” he repeated, uncertain. “How could that make a difference?”

Aisha hesitated, organizing her thoughts. “Think about it,” she explained slowly, “if the curse binds based on a need for connection, maybe it manifests differently depending on who the connection is with. If Mahrosh were tethered to another woman, maybe they’d both feel the same symptoms, like the suffocation. But with you—”

“You’re saying that the curse affects us differently because he’s a man?” Mahrosh finished, her eyes widening. “So that’s why I’m suffocating, but Saim’s not.”

“Possibly,” Aisha nodded. “I’ve read about curses in folklore that affect people differently, depending on things like family ties, gender, or even specific fears or vulnerabilities.” She paused, glancing at Saim. “And it doesn’t necessarily mean the same effects for each person.”

Saim shook his head, frowning as he tried to piece it together. “So the curse is trying to keep us close—specifically close enough for Mahrosh not to feel that… suffocation. And since we’re not bound in the same way, she’s the one suffering if we’re too far apart.”

A silence fell over the room as the implications of Aisha’s theory settled in. Mahrosh’s hands began to shake slightly, and she clenched them tightly together to steady herself. “So, what do we do?” she whispered, glancing up at Saim and Aisha. “If this curse is tied to gender, how do we break it?”

Aisha considered this, her face calm but eyes sharp with determination. “There might be a way. If it is gender-based, we need to test whether the curse behaves the same way with someone else—a woman who hasn’t yet touched the painting.” She looked at Mahrosh with a hint of hesitation. “Someone you trust, who could potentially take Saim’s place, even just to understand the curse’s boundaries.”

Mahrosh’s eyes widened in alarm. “You’re suggesting that I… ask another woman to touch it?” The very thought sent a chill down her spine.

“I know it sounds risky,” Aisha said softly, “but we need answers. And if it means we can lessen your suffering… it might be worth trying.”

The room fell into tense silence as Mahrosh, Saim, and Aisha weighed the decision ahead. The path forward was uncertain, and whatever lay beyond it would demand even more courage and trust than they had shown so far.

Saim’s face darkened as he absorbed Aisha’s suggestion, his jaw clenching. “Absolutely not,” he said firmly, his tone leaving no room for debate. “First, the painting won’t even be there anymore. It was a temporary display for the exhibition, so there’s no chance of anyone else touching it. And second,” he added, his eyes narrowing as he looked from Aisha to Mahrosh, “I won’t allow anyone—Mahrosh, you, or anyone else—to go near that cursed thing. It’s dangerous. We’ll find another way to break this curse.”

Mahrosh sighed, feeling the tension in the room grow thick enough to cut through. She appreciated Saim’s protectiveness, but there was a stubborn streak in his voice that made the situation feel all the more hopeless. Aisha pressed her lips together, giving her husband a sidelong look but not pushing the issue further.

Sensing the growing heaviness of the conversation, Saim leaned back in his chair, suddenly flashing a mischievous grin. “Alright, Mahrosh,” he said, crossing his arms with an exaggeratedly relaxed air, “since I’ve risked my life—on multiple occasions now—trying to keep you alive, I think it’s time you paid me back.”

Mahrosh’s eyebrows shot up, her anxiety momentarily pushed aside by surprise. “What?”

“Tea,” he said, with a smug smile. “A nice, steaming cup. Oh, and don’t forget to press my shoulders. My muscles are all sore from chasing after you.” He raised an eyebrow, clearly trying to lighten the mood. “If you disobey, just saying, I might decide to test the curse myself… by running right out the door.”

Mahrosh gaped at him, caught between exasperation and a reluctant smile. “Saim, that’s not fair!”

“Hey, we all have to make sacrifices,” he replied, smirking. “Now, tea—and maybe a little shoulder massage, if you please.” He leaned forward, pretending to stretch his legs toward the door. “Or I might just make a break for it.”

Aisha let out a surprised laugh, shaking her head. “Saim, really?” she teased, clearly amused. “You’re blackmailing her into making tea?”

“Not just tea,” he corrected, grinning wider. “Tea with a side of obedience.” He leaned back, winking at Mahrosh. “Now get to it before I change my mind.”

Mahrosh rolled her eyes, feigning annoyance but feeling a smile tugging at her lips as she stood up, moving toward the kitchen. “Fine, but don’t think this makes you any less cursed,” she muttered. “You’re more cursed than ever.”

As she filled the kettle, the laughter that followed her was warm and genuine, softening the edges of the grim reality they all faced.
