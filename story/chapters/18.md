### Chapter 18: **The Final Hours**  

Mahrosh sat curled on the floor of her room, the dim light of her bedside lamp casting flickering shadows on the walls. The heat that had plagued her all day had grown unbearable, her skin burning as though flames licked at her from the inside. She clutched a damp towel to her face, but it did nothing to ease the fever or the growing weight in her chest.  

Her phone buzzed on the bed beside her. With trembling hands, she grabbed it, Saim's name flashing on the screen.  

"Mahrosh," his voice came through, tense and urgent. "How are you feeling?"  

She opened her mouth to speak, but all that came out was a shaky breath. The words stuck in her throat, her mind too clouded to form sentences.  

"I’m coming over," Saim said quickly, his tone leaving no room for argument.  

"No," she whispered hoarsely. "It’ll make it worse. Usama said—"  

"To hell with what Usama said!" Saim snapped, his frustration breaking through. "You’re not going through this alone. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes."  

The line went dead, leaving Mahrosh staring at the screen, her heart racing. She tried to stand but collapsed back onto her knees, the room spinning around her. Her vision blurred, and for a moment, she thought she saw the Old Lady’s eyes staring back at her from the dark corners of the room.  

"Get out of my head," she hissed, clutching at her temples.  

The air grew heavy, the shadows in the room deepening. The faint sound of whispers filled her ears, unintelligible but insistent. She tried to block them out, pressing her hands against her ears, but they only grew louder.  

When the knock came at her door, it was sharp and urgent. She dragged herself to her feet, her legs wobbling as she stumbled toward it.  

"Mahrosh?" Saim’s voice called from the other side.  

She opened the door, her vision swimming. Saim stood there, his face pale but determined. He stepped inside without waiting for an invitation, his eyes immediately scanning her appearance.  

"You look worse," he said bluntly, closing the door behind him.  

"Thanks," she muttered, her voice rasping.  

Saim grabbed a chair and pulled it close to her. "Listen to me. Usama said this is it. We don’t have days, Mahrosh. We have hours—maybe less."  

Her legs gave out, and she sank onto the edge of the bed, staring at him. "What does that mean, Saim? What are we supposed to do?"  

Saim hesitated, his jaw tightening. His hand hovered over hers but didn’t touch, as if afraid to make it worse. "There’s one thing we haven’t tried. Something Usama didn’t want to say out loud."  

Mahrosh’s breath hitched, her voice trembling. "What is it?"  

Saim hesitated, his eyes locking onto hers. The room seemed to close in around them, the weight of the curse palpable.  

"It’s... me," he said finally, his voice barely audible. "I have to..."  

The whispers grew louder, drowning out his words as the shadows in the room stretched, reaching for them.  

"Saim," Mahrosh said, her voice breaking, "what are you saying? What are you going to do?"  

But Saim didn’t answer. He stood, his expression unreadable, and turned toward the door.  

Mahrosh reached for him, her hand trembling. "Saim, no. Don’t—"  

The room plunged into darkness, the whispers turning into a deafening roar. For a brief moment, she thought she saw the Old Lady’s silhouette standing behind Saim, her hand outstretched.  

And then...
