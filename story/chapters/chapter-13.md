# Chapter 13: **The Forgotten Archive**

The following morning, Mahrosh woke to a strange sense of clarity. Despite the lingering tension of Usama's ominous words, her mind felt unusually sharp, as if urging her to act before the curse could tighten its grip. She wasted no time, right on her bed she texted Saim to meet her at the university library.

Today she reached the university thirty minutes before the actual time, and by the time Saim arrived, Mahrosh was already surrounded by books, old journals, and a stack of faded documents she had managed to unearth from the library's restricted archive. The room smelled of aged paper and dust, and the faint hum of the air conditioning created a solemn atmosphere.

"I think you didn't sleep?" Saim asked, setting his bag down.

"Not a minute," Mahrosh replied, not looking up from the journal she was reading. "We need answers, Saim. If what Usama said is true, and this 'Lady of Shadows' is looking for a host..." She trailed off, her voice trembling slightly.

Saim pulled up a chair, his expression grim. "Where do we even start?"

Mahrosh slid a journal toward him. "This is the oldest record I could find about the painting. It mentions an artist named Louis Aubert who lived in Paris during the late 19th century. He was known for his experimental art but disappeared under mysterious circumstances after completing a painting described exactly like ours."

Saim's eyes scanned the page, his brows furrowing. "It says here he was obsessed with a woman named Leila. Someone he claimed could 'channel the divine.'" He looked up at Mahrosh. "Do you think she's the Old Lady?"

"Possibly," Mahrosh said. "But there's more. This journal says that Aubert believed Leila's spirit was bound to the painting, preserving her essence for eternity."

Saim leaned back, his mind racing. "So, he trapped her in the painting?"

Mahrosh nodded. "And she's been using it ever since to search for a new host. Someone she can fully inhabit."

Their conversation was interrupted by the librarian, an elderly man with spectacles perched on the edge of his nose. He approached cautiously, carrying a thick, leather-bound ledger. "I couldn't help but overhear," he said softly. "If you're looking into the painting's origins, you might find this useful. It's a record of European art auctions that took place in Lahore decades ago."

Mahrosh and Saim exchanged a glance before eagerly flipping through the ledger. Among the listings, they found an entry dated 1965:  

'The Lady of Shadows: Anonymous Artist. Acquired by A. Shahbaz.'

"Who's A. Shahbaz?" Saim asked, scanning the page for more details.  

"Shahbaz might refer to the Shahbaz family," the librarian said. "They were prominent art collectors in Lahore during the mid-20th century. Their estate was turned into a private gallery after the family's decline."  

"Do you know where this gallery is?" Mahrosh asked urgently.  

The librarian nodded. "It's not far... on the outskirts of the city. But I must warn you, it's been abandoned for years."

By late afternoon, Mahrosh and Saim stood in front of the crumbling gates of the Shahbaz estate. The once-grand mansion was now overrun with vines, its windows shattered and its walls weathered by decades of neglect.  

"This place looks like it belongs in a horror movie," Saim muttered, pushing the gates open with a loud creak.  

Mahrosh tightened her grip on her scarf, her eyes darting around nervously. "If the painting was here, maybe we'll find something about why it's cursed."  

Inside, the air was thick with dust and decay. The remnants of the Shahbaz family's collection were scattered across the main hall... broken frames, faded tapestries, and overturned furniture. They moved cautiously, their footsteps echoing eerily in the vast, empty space.  

In the corner of the hall, they found a large, wooden trunk. Its lock was rusted, but with some effort, Saim managed to pry it open. Inside were stacks of letters, ledgers, and a leather-bound diary with the initials A.S engraved on the cover.  

Mahrosh opened the diary carefully, flipping through its yellowed pages. "It's written by Ahmed Shahbaz," she murmured. "He talks about acquiring the painting at an auction in Paris. He thought it was just a valuable antique, but then... he started noticing strange things."  

Saim leaned closer as she read aloud:  

"The eyes... they follow me everywhere. I hear her voice in my dreams, calling my name. I feel her presence even when I'm alone. She wants something from me, but I cannot decipher her intentions. My family has begged me to get rid of it, but I can't. It's as if she won't let me."  

Mahrosh shivered, her fingers trembling as she turned the page. The final entry was short but chilling:  

"If you're reading this, leave now. The Lady of Shadows is not bound to the painting alone. She can reach beyond it, into those who seek her secrets. Run, before it's too late."  

The diary slipped from Mahrosh's hands, hitting the floor with a soft thud.  

"We need to leave," she whispered, her voice barely audible.  

Saim didn't argue. They turned and hurried out of the estate, the weight of Ahmed Shahbaz's warning heavy in their minds.

That night, Mahrosh couldn't sleep. Her dreams were vivid and fragmented, filled with fleeting images of the Old Lady's face, her penetrating eyes staring straight into Mahrosh's soul.  

When she awoke in a cold sweat, her phone buzzed with a message from Saim, "I can feel her too. We're running out of time."

Mahrosh stared at the screen, dread settling in her chest like a stone. Whatever the Lady of Shadows wanted, she was getting closer... and their time to uncover the truth was slipping away.
