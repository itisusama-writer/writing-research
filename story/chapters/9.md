# The Meeting for Help

The tension between Mahrosh and Saim didn't ease as they stared at the number Masooma had sent. After a long silence, Mahrosh sighed and dialed. Saim leaned in, his expression unreadable as the call connected.

"Hello?" a deep, calm voice answered.

"Is this Usama?" Mahrosh asked hesitantly.

"Yes," the voice replied, carrying an air of authority. "Who's calling?"

"My name is Mahrosh Javaid. I... Masooma Zehra suggested we contact you. She said you might be able to help us with... a curse."

There was a pause on the other end, long enough that Mahrosh glanced nervously at Saim. Then Usama spoke again, his tone careful but direct. "Tell me where you are and what's happening to you."

Mahrosh recounted their experience... the suffocation, the bond, and the cursed painting. Usama listened in silence, his breathing steady but deliberate.

"I know this curse," Usama finally said, his voice dropping an octave. "The energy I'm sensing... it's from the Old Lady."

"The Old Lady?" Saim repeated, frowning.

"It's what we call her... the entity tied to that painting," Usama explained. "Her energy is distinctive and dangerous. If you're caught in her web, you won't escape unscathed."

"What can we do?" Mahrosh asked quickly, desperation creeping into her voice.

"I can meet you," Usama replied. "We'll talk in person. Pak Tea House tomorrow afternoon. Two o'clock."

The bustling atmosphere of Pak Tea House was in stark contrast to the unease in Mahrosh and Saim's hearts. They sat at a corner table, glancing around anxiously until a ordinary, composed young man approached them.

"Mahrosh? Saim?" he asked, his piercing eyes locking onto theirs.

They nodded, and he slid into the seat across from them. "I'm Usama," he said simply.

From the moment they shook hands, Usama's expression shifted, his gaze sharpening. "I can feel it," he murmured, his tone almost reverent. "The energy is unmistakable. The Old Lady's presence is clinging to you both."

Mahrosh swallowed hard. "Can you help us?"

Usama leaned back, studying them. "I can help you manage it... to store the energy, to make it easier to live with. But breaking this curse..." He trailed off, his lips pressing into a thin line.

"Breaking it isn't possible?" Saim asked, leaning forward.

Usama hesitated, glancing briefly at Mahrosh before focusing on Saim. "There's one way. A bond of this nature can sometimes be overpowered by another bond... one that is equally unbreakable."

Usama nodded, pulling out a small notebook and scribbling something down. "There's a way to store energy more efficiently, but it requires trust. Are you both willing to do whatever it takes?"

Mahrosh nodded without hesitation. "Yes."

Saim hesitated, his eyes narrowing. "What exactly does it involve?"

Usama looked between them, his expression serious. "Saim, your blood. The bond ties the two of you together, but sharing your life force will allow Mahrosh to sustain herself for longer periods without needing your proximity."

Mahrosh blinked in surprise but nodded. "If it'll help, I'll do it."

Saim stared at Usama, his fists clenched. "You want me to... inject my blood into her?"

"Yes," Usama said matter-of-factly. "A small amount. It's symbolic as much as it is practical. Her body will respond to the bond by absorbing the energy more directly."

Saim shook his head, his discomfort evident. "This is insane."

"You said you wanted to save her," Usama said sharply. "This is the safest way to make that happen. And 1mm will last her for whole week. Although it is better than holding hands."

Mahrosh placed a hand on Saim's arm, her voice steady but soft. "Saim, I'll be okay. If this works, it'll buy us time to figure out the rest."

Saim sighed, rubbing his temples before nodding reluctantly. "Alright. Let's do it."

After detailing the procedure, Usama turned to Saim. "Walk with me for a moment," he said.

Saim glanced at Mahrosh, who gave him a questioning look. "I'll be right back," he assured her before following Usama to a quieter corner of the tea house.

When they were out of earshot, Usama faced him, his expression unreadable. "The blood injection will work for now. It'll give her some breathing room, but you need to understand... it's a temporary solution."

Saim's brows furrowed. "You've said that. What's your point?"

Usama's voice dropped, his tone firm. "A bond like this, forged through the Old Lady's curse, isn't just physical. It's emotional, spiritual, all-encompassing. That's why it feeds on proximity. To override it completely, you'd need a bond that's equally unbreakable."

"What are you saying?" Saim asked warily, though he already sensed the answer.

"Marriage," Usama said simply. "A marriage between the two of you would create a bond strong enough to neutralize the curse's effects. It would make the tether natural, rather than forced."

Saim froze, his jaw tightening. "That's not an option," he said flatly.

"I'm not saying you should act on it," Usama replied, his tone measured. "But if you want to ensure her survival and regain some semblance of normalcy, it's the only permanent solution I can see."

Saim clenched his fists, his mind racing. For a brief, fleeting moment, the thought lingeredâ€”what if it worked? Could he do it?

"No," he said firmly, shaking his head. "There has to be another way."

Usama sighed but nodded. "Then focus on what we discussed. The blood injection will buy you time. But remember, time isn't on your side."

Saim didn't respond, his jaw tight as he turned back toward Mahrosh. Usama watched him go, his expression thoughtful, before following silently.
