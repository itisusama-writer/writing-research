# It Started Again

Mahrosh's two days past with ease but on the second morning, as she sat in class, an all-too-familiar tightness began to creep over her chest. At first, she tried to ignore it, assuming it was just nerves or the stress of the past few days. But as the minutes passed, her breathing grew more labored, and she clutched at her desk for support.

"I... I can't..." she gasped, her vision beginning to blur.

Nur, the friend sitting beside her, noticed immediately. "Mahrosh, what's wrong?" she asked, her voice panicked.

"I need... Saim," Mahrosh managed to choke out, barely audible.

Nur didn't waste a second. She darted out of the classroom, searching the nearby halls. Moments later, Saim appeared in the doorway, his face a mask of worry. He rushed to Mahrosh's side, kneeling beside her.

"Mahrosh! I'm here. Look at me," he said, gripping her hand tightly. As soon as their hands touched, the suffocating feeling eased, her breaths coming more freely.

The classroom fell silent, all eyes on them. Saim ignored the stares, his focus solely on Mahrosh. "You okay now?" he asked softly, his tone gentle.

She nodded weakly, tears brimming in her eyes. "I... I don't know what happened."

Saim helped her to her feet, his arm steadying her. "Let's get out of here," he said, guiding her toward the hallway.

The whispers followed them as they left, but neither of them cared. For now, the only thing that mattered was figuring out why this was happening... and how to stop it before it tore their lives apart.

Sitting on the edge of the university's grassy ground, Mahrosh and Saim leaned against a bench, their expressions filled with both exhaustion and contemplation. The campus buzzed with life around them, but their conversation felt removed, as if they existed in a separate world entirely.

"One hour is not a day," Mahrosh said, frustration evident in her voice. She twisted her scarf between her fingers, her brows furrowed in thought. "I was okay for less than 24 hours this time."

Saim nodded, his face serious. "We need to figure out what's going on with this curse. It's like... it's inconsistent."

Mahrosh paused, her mind racing back to their earlier attempts to store energy. "Wait," she said suddenly, sitting upright. "Remember the day we held hands for four hours? I didn't feel anything for two whole days after that. That's double the time!"

Saim's eyebrows shot up as he considered her words. "Four hours equals two days? That means the longer we... um..." He trailed off, glancing awkwardly at their hands.

"Yeah," Mahrosh finished, meeting his gaze. "The longer we stay connected, the more energy gets stored. But it's not practical to do that here."

"Exactly," Saim said, his tone firm. "We can't just sit around holding hands at the university. People already think something's going on between us, and I can't risk making it worse. My wife trusts me, but this would... it'd look bad."

Mahrosh sighed, nodding in agreement. "You're right. We need a place where no one will see us. Somewhere outdoors, where we won't be judged or questioned."

They fell into silence, their minds working in sync. After a moment, Saim spoke up, a hint of hesitation in his voice. "There's a park outside near Anarkali. It's usually quiet, especially during the weekdays. We could go there and... you know, spend more time trying this energy thing."

Mahrosh tilted her head, considering the idea. "That might work," she said slowly. "But what if someone still recognizes us? People talk, Saim. They'll make it worse than it already is."

"Then we go farther," Saim said decisively. "Somewhere no one knows us. We'll drive out of Lahore if we have to."

Mahrosh blinked, surprised at his determination. "You'd do that?"

Saim gave a half-smile, shrugging. "I don't think we have a choice. If we don't figure this out, it's going to get worse for both of us. And..." He hesitated, looking away. "I don't want to see you like this, Mahrosh. Struggling to breathe, collapsing in class... it's not right."

Her chest tightened, not from suffocation this time, but from the sincerity in his voice. She looked down at their hands, fingers brushing slightly. "Okay," she said softly. "Let's do it. Tomorrow morning, we'll skip class and go somewhere far. Somewhere safe."

Saim nodded, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Good. Pack some snacks or something. If we're stuck holding hands for hours, at least we can eat."

Mahrosh chuckled despite herself, the heaviness of their situation momentarily lifted. For a brief moment, it almost felt like old times... just two friends joking around, unburdened by curses or whispered judgments.

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, the plan solidified in their minds. They would find a way to break free, even if it meant holding on... quite literally... to each other for as long as it took.
