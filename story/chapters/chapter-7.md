# It Started Again

Mahrosh's two days past with ease but on the second morning, as she sat in class, an all-too-familiar tightness began to creep over her chest. At first, she tried to ignore it, assuming it was just nerves or the stress of the past few days. But as the minutes passed, her breathing grew more labored, and she clutched at her desk for support.

"I... I can't..." she gasped, her vision beginning to blur.

Nur, the friend sitting beside her, noticed immediately. "Mahrosh, what's wrong?" she asked, her voice panicked.

"I need... Saim," Mahrosh managed to choke out, barely audible.

Nur didn't waste a second. She darted out of the classroom, searching the nearby halls. Moments later, Saim appeared in the doorway, his face a mask of worry. He rushed to Mahrosh's side, kneeling beside her.

"Mahrosh! I'm here. Look at me," he said, gripping her hand tightly. As soon as their hands touched, the suffocating feeling eased, her breaths coming more freely.

The classroom fell silent, all eyes on them. Saim ignored the stares, his focus solely on Mahrosh. "You okay now?" he asked softly, his tone gentle.

She nodded weakly, tears brimming in her eyes. "I... I don't know what happened."

Saim helped her to her feet, his arm steadying her. "Let's get out of here," he said, guiding her toward the hallway.

The whispers followed them as they left, but neither of them cared. For now, the only thing that mattered was figuring out why this was happening... and how to stop it before it tore their lives apart.

Sitting on the edge of the university's grassy ground, Mahrosh and Saim leaned against a bench, their expressions filled with both exhaustion and contemplation. The campus buzzed with life around them, but their conversation felt removed, as if they existed in a separate world entirely.

"One hour is not a day," Mahrosh said, frustration evident in her voice. She twisted her scarf between her fingers, her brows furrowed in thought. "I was okay for less than 24 hours this time."

Saim nodded, his face serious. "We need to figure out what's going on with this curse. It's like... it's inconsistent."

Mahrosh paused, her mind racing back to their earlier attempts to store energy. "Wait," she said suddenly, sitting upright. "Remember the day we held hands for four hours? I didn't feel anything for two whole days after that. That's double the time!"

Saim's eyebrows shot up as he considered her words. "Four hours equals two days? That means the longer we... um..." He trailed off, glancing awkwardly at their hands.

"Yeah," Mahrosh finished, meeting his gaze. "The longer we stay connected, the more energy gets stored. But it's not practical to do that here."

"Exactly," Saim said, his tone firm. "We can't just sit around holding hands at the university. People already think something's going on between us, and I can't risk making it worse. My wife trusts me, but this would... it'd look bad."

Mahrosh sighed, nodding in agreement. "You're right. We need a place where no one will see us. Somewhere outdoors, where we won't be judged or questioned."

They fell into silence, their minds working in sync. After a moment, Saim spoke up, a hint of hesitation in his voice. "There's a park outside near Anarkali. It's usually quiet, especially during the weekdays. We could go there and... you know, spend more time trying this energy thing."

Mahrosh tilted her head, considering the idea. "That might work," she said slowly. "But what if someone still recognizes us? People talk, Saim. They'll make it worse than it already is."

Saim's gaze turned serious as he studied Mahrosh's face. Her unease was clear, and it mirrored his own. This curse wasn't just tying them together; it was slowly dismantling their lives, piece by piece.

"You're right," Saim said finally, his voice steady. "We can't risk being seen there. But this isn't just about appearances anymore. Your health is on the line. If we don't figure this out, it'll only get worse."

Mahrosh leaned back, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of her scarf. "Then what do we do? We can't just keep hiding and hoping no one notices."

A moment of silence passed between them, the weight of the curse pressing down heavily. Saim's mind raced, searching for an answer. Then it hit him.

"There's one more option," he said carefully.

Mahrosh looked up, her brow furrowed. "What is it?"

Saim hesitated, glancing around to ensure no one was within earshot. "The rooftop of my apartment building," he said carefully. "It's private, quiet, and no one goes up there. We could figure this out without anyone watching."

Mahrosh frowned, her unease growing. "But what about Aisha? She's been understanding so far, but if someone like Ali gets wind of this…" Her voice trailed off, the potential fallout hanging heavy between them.

Saim ran a hand through his hair, frustration etched on his face. "I know it's risky, but what other option do we have? The park isn't safe, and your house…"

"Is out of the question," Mahrosh finished, sighing. "My parents are already on edge because of Ali's interference."

Saim leaned forward, his voice steady but firm. "I'll talk to Aisha. I'll explain everything. She trusts me, Mahrosh, and I'll make sure she knows this is about survival, not... anything else."

Mahrosh nodded slowly, though her doubt lingered. "And what if Ali finds out? You know he'll twist this into something ugly."

Saim hesitated, glancing around cautiously. "We'll have to be smart about this," he said. "What about the rooftop of my apartment building? It's private, quiet, and we can figure this out without anyone watching."

Mahrosh shook her head immediately. "I can't risk being there too late, Saim. If Ali finds out, he'll blow it out of proportion, and my parents will never believe it's innocent. I can't keep sneaking around like this."

Saim sighed, running a hand over his face. "Okay, you're right. Then we'll go during the day, but only for short periods—when people are least likely to notice. I'll let Aisha know in advance, so there's no misunderstanding."

Mahrosh's eyes widened. "You'd tell Aisha?"

"Yes," Saim said firmly. "She trusts me, and I don't want this to become a source of tension. If she knows what's happening, we won't have to hide anything."

Mahrosh's shoulders slumped as she considered the plan. "And what about Ali? He's practically looking for a reason to cause trouble."

"We'll make it look normal," Saim replied. "If anyone asks, you're helping me with a project. No late-night meetups, no suspicious behavior. We'll keep this as low-profile as possible."

Mahrosh exhaled slowly, her mind racing through the possibilities. The rooftop was still risky, but with Aisha aware and precautions in place, it might just work.

"Alright," she said, her voice tinged with hesitation. "But if Ali or anyone else so much as raises a question, we stop immediately."

"Deal," Saim said, his tone softening. "We'll be careful, Mahrosh. I promise."
