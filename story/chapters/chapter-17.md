### Chapter 17: **The Bad News**  

The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the campus as Saim made his way to the agreed meeting spot near the Fine Arts Building. His steps were heavy, his thoughts a swirling mess. Mahrosh had taken the day off, claiming she needed rest, but her voice over the phone had been shaky, her words strained.  

Usama stood near the stone bench under an old neem tree, a slim notebook in his hand. His face was calm, but his eyes betrayed a storm of thoughts. When he saw Saim approaching, he gave a curt nod.  

"You came alone," Usama remarked, his tone neutral.  

"Mahrosh's not feeling well," Saim replied, sitting across from him. "She’s burning up, drenched in sweat. She stayed home."  

Usama leaned back slightly, his gaze narrowing. "It’s not just the curse anymore," he said grimly. "I need to tell you what’s happening... and you’re not going to like it."  

Saim stiffened. "What do you mean? Is it getting worse?"  

Usama sighed, closing the notebook in his hand. "The signs are clear. The Old Lady’s presence is no longer external. She’s found her way inside Mahrosh."  

Saim’s stomach twisted. "Inside? You’re saying she’s... possessed?"  

"It’s not full possession yet," Usama clarified, though his voice carried no comfort. "But she’s taken root. The heat, the visions, the mark—they’re all signs. The Old Lady is weaving herself into Mahrosh’s very being. And once the merging is complete..."  

Saim clenched his fists, his voice low and urgent. "What happens then?"  

Usama’s gaze locked onto his, unwavering. "Then Mahrosh is gone. The Old Lady will take over completely, using her as a host. Her soul will be consumed, leaving nothing behind."  

The words hit Saim like a blow, his breath catching in his throat. He leaned forward, his voice desperate. "There has to be a way to stop it. Another injection? Some ritual? Anything!"  

Usama shook his head slowly. "The injections were a temporary fix, a way to delay the inevitable. But this curse... it was designed to end in one of two ways. Either the host fully succumbs, or..." He trailed off, hesitating.  

"Or what?" Saim demanded, his tone sharp.  

Usama leaned in, his voice low and heavy. "Or the bond is severed entirely. And that’s not something the curse allows easily. Severing it means one of you has to..." He hesitated again, the weight of the word hanging unspoken.  

"Die," Saim finished for him, his voice hollow.  

Usama nodded, his expression grim. "It’s not a solution anyone wants, but it’s the reality of this curse. The Old Lady thrives on bonds. If the bond is gone, she loses her hold. But Mahrosh’s body is already marked. She’s the primary target. If we don’t act fast..."  

Saim leaned back, running a hand through his hair. His mind raced with the implications, with the weight of Usama’s words.  

"How long do we have?" he asked finally.  

"Days," Usama replied. "A week at most before she’s gone entirely. And the closer you two stay, the faster it progresses. She’s feeding off your connection."  

Saim’s chest tightened as he tried to process the impossible choices before him. "So, what do we do now?"  

Usama stood, his expression steely. "I’ll look into anything that might delay her progress further, but I won’t give you false hope, Saim. This isn’t something that ends well. Prepare yourself for the worst."  

Saim nodded slowly, his throat dry. As Usama walked away, his words lingered like a shadow over Saim’s thoughts.  

When he finally stood to leave, the weight of the curse felt heavier than ever. Time was running out, and Mahrosh was slipping through his fingers.
