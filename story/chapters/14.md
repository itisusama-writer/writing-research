### Chapter 14: **Echoes in the Silence**  

Mahrosh sat cross-legged on her bed, the morning light streaming through her curtains casting long, uneven shadows across the room. Her laptop hummed quietly on the bedside table, its screen dark after hours of inactivity. She had spent the night poring over every detail of Ahmed Shahbaz's diary and the auction records, her eyes burning from lack of sleep. The silence in the house felt oppressive, broken only by the occasional distant sounds of her family downstairs. Yet, within her room, it felt as though she wasn't truly alone. The blood injection is still working, keeping her breathing steady, but a gnawing unease had taken its place.

Beads of sweat began to form on her forehead, the air around her growing inexplicably warmer. She wiped her face with the back of her hand but stopped when she noticed her palm trembling. Her shirt clung to her back, damp with perspiration, and a faint dizziness crept in.

"What's happening now?" she murmured to herself, her voice shaky.

Standing abruptly, she stumbled to the bathroom, stripping off her clothes as the humid air pressed against her skin.  Before she could close the bathroom door, a sharp knock echoed from her bedroom door, followed by her sister Rabia's voice.

"Mahrosh? Are you okay?" Rabia called, the concern in her tone unmistakable.

Mahrosh froze, clutching her towel to her chest, her heart racing. "I'm fine!" she shouted back, trying to steady her voice.

The door creaked open slightly, and Rabia's head peeked through. Her eyes darted to the disheveled state of the room, then back to Mahrosh, narrowing. "You don't look fine," she said, stepping inside.

"I said I'm fine," Mahrosh repeated, sharper this time, avoiding her sister's probing gaze.

Rabia crossed her arms, her brows knitting together. "What's going on, Mahrosh? You're pale, sweating... Did something happen?"

Mahrosh shook her head quickly, retreating into the bathroom and shutting the door firmly behind her. "Just give me a minute, Rabia!"

The silence that followed was thick, but Rabia didn't leave. "I'm waiting outside," she said, her voice quieter now, but firm. She continues her shower. 

For a moment, the sensation grounded her, the rhythmic pattering of water on tiles drowning out the frantic hum of her thoughts.

As the water flowed, she closed her eyes, hoping to wash away not just the sweat but the mounting fear as well. However, behind her closed lids, images began to form—flashes of the Old Lady's face, her dark, penetrating eyes locking onto her. Mahrosh gasped, her eyes snapping open as she stumbled backward against the cold tiles.

She turned off the water hastily and wrapped herself in a towel, her chest heaving. This wasn't normal. It wasn't just stress or exhaustion anymore—it was the curse tightening its grip, infiltrating her mind.

Wrapping herself in a towel, Mahrosh hesitated at the bathroom door. She could hear Rabia shifting in the room, her footsteps soft but insistent as they paced the floor. Taking a deep breath, she opened the door.

Rabia turned immediately, her arms still crossed and her expression stern. "Are you going to tell me what's going on now?"

Mahrosh avoided her gaze, walking past her to the dresser. "I told you, I'm fine. It's just... I didn't sleep well last night, that's all."

"Don't lie to me," Rabia snapped, stepping closer. "You've been acting weird for days now. Amma and Abba might not notice, but I do."

Mahrosh's hands froze mid-motion as she reached for her clothes. She could feel Rabia's piercing gaze on her back. Rabia's sharp intake of breath made Mahrosh pause. 

"What is that?" Rabia asked, her voice trembling with a mix of shock and confusion.  

"What's what?" Mahrosh replied, turning her head slightly, trying to see what her sister was talking about.  

Rabia stepped closer, her hand hovering just inches from Mahrosh's shoulder blade. "There's... there's a mark on your back. It looks like a..." She stopped, struggling to find the words.  

Mahrosh spun around, her brows furrowed. "A mark? What are you talking about?"  

Without waiting for permission, Rabia grabbed a small handheld mirror from the dresser and held it up behind Mahrosh. "Here, look for yourself."  

Mahrosh took the mirror with shaking hands, angling it over her shoulder to see her reflection. Her breath caught in her throat. There, etched into her skin just below her left shoulder blade, was a faint, swirling mark. It looked almost like an intricate, ancient symbol... a blend of curves and sharp edges that seemed both beautiful and ominous.  

She ran her fingers over it, the skin smooth to the touch, but the sight of it sent a shiver down her spine. "I didn't... I didn't know this was there," she whispered, her voice barely audible.  

"What is it?" Rabia asked, her tone urgent. "Is it a tattoo? A scar? How long have you had it?"  

"I don't know," Mahrosh said, panic creeping into her voice. "I've never seen it before. I... I don't even know how it got there."  

Rabia stepped back, her eyes narrowing. "Mahrosh, this isn't normal. You've been acting strange, and now this? You need to tell me what's really going on."  

Mahrosh turned away, clutching the towel tighter around herself. Her mind raced, the mark an undeniable reminder of the curse's growing hold on her. But how could she explain it to Rabia without sounding insane?  

"I can't," she said finally, her voice breaking. "You wouldn't understand."  

"Try me," Rabia insisted, her voice softening slightly. "You're my sister, Mahrosh. Whatever this is, I want to help you."  

For a moment, Mahrosh considered telling her everything—the curse, the painting, the suffocation. But the words caught in her throat, and all she could manage was, "I'm fine, Rabia. Just... please, leave me alone for now."  

Rabia hesitated, her concern evident, but she nodded reluctantly. "Fine," she said quietly. "But this isn't over. You need to figure out what's happening to you, Mahrosh, before it's too late."  

As Rabia left the room, Mahrosh sank onto the edge of her bed, the mirror still in her hand. She stared at the mark, dread pooling in her stomach. Whatever this was, it was just another piece of the puzzle—a puzzle that seemed to grow darker and more twisted with every step.
