# Back Home  

Mahrosh finally reached home, the warm glow of the porch light offering a false sense of comfort. Steeling herself, she stepped inside, only to find the living room steeped in an unsettling silence. Her Amma and Abba sat on the sofa, their faces taut with unspoken emotions. The muted hum of the ceiling fan was the only sound, and it grated against Mahrosh's nerves.  

She hesitated, her fingers gripping the edge of the door as it clicked shut behind her. "Asalamualaikum," she greeted softly, her voice breaking the stillness.  

Her Amma replied curtly, not meeting her eyes. "Walaikum Salam." Her tone carried the weight of disappointment.  

Mahrosh's heart sank, and she turned toward the kitchen, hoping for some clarity. There, she found her elder sister Rabia, chopping vegetables with deliberate force, her movements sharp and purposeful.  

"Rabia," Mahrosh asked cautiously, "what's going on? Did something happen?"  

Rabia glanced up, her expression a mix of concern and irritation. She hesitated before setting the knife down. "Ali told them," she said flatly.  

Mahrosh frowned, confused. "Ali? Told them what?"  

Rabia sighed, folding her arms. "That you were with a boy. He saw you and Saim together on campus."  

Mahrosh froze, her breath catching. "But Saim is just my best friend!" she protested, her voice rising in disbelief. "And he's married!"  

Rabia shrugged, her tone edged with resignation. "You know how Amma and Abba think. They don't care if he's married or not. They only care how it looks to other people. And now they're upset because it looks bad."  

Fuming, Mahrosh stormed into the living room, her anger simmering just below the surface. "Amma, Abba, I didn't do anything wrong," she said, her voice trembling with emotion. "Saim is my friend, and that's all. You can't assume the worst just because someone saw us together."  

Her father, who had been silent, finally looked up, his tone low and measured. "We're not saying you did anything wrong, Mahrosh. But you need to understand how people talk. It's about our family's reputation. We can't afford to give anyone reason to gossip."  

Mahrosh bit her lip, trying to contain the anger threatening to spill over. "I won't stop being friends with him," she said firmly. "He's helped me through so much, and I'm not going to let baseless assumptions ruin that."  

Her mother sighed, her expression softening slightly. "Just... be careful," she murmured. "That's all we ask."  

Before Mahrosh could respond, the sound of a chair scraping against the floor caught her attention. Ali, her cousin, stepped out from the adjacent room. His smug expression made her blood boil.  

"You should be thankful I told them," Ali said, his voice laced with self-righteousness. "I'm just looking out for you. Someone needed to stop you from making a fool of yourself."  

Mahrosh turned on him, her eyes blazing. "Who the hell are you to decide what I do with my life?" she snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through the tension.  

Ali flinched but quickly recovered, crossing his arms. "I'm family, Mahrosh. It's my responsibility to make sure you don't ruin our name..."  

"Ruin our name?" Mahrosh interrupted, her voice trembling with fury. "By what? Having a friend? You don't get to control me or dictate my choices. You're not some moral authority, Ali, so stay out of my life."  

Ali's face darkened, but he stayed silent, sensing that any retort would only escalate the situation.  

"Next time," Mahrosh continued, her voice icy yet trembling, "keep your judgments and gossip to yourself. You've done enough damage already."  

Her words hung in the air like shards of glass, sharp and cutting. Ali stiffened, his mouth opening as if to retort, but the fire in her eyes silenced him. The room seemed to shrink under the weight of her anger, every breath taut with tension.  

Without waiting for a reply, Mahrosh turned on her heel, her fists clenched tightly at her sides. Her footsteps pounded up the stairs, each step echoing her frustration and hurt. She stormed into her room, slamming the door behind her with a force that rattled the walls.  

Once inside, her defiance crumbled. The air felt thick, and her chest heaved as tears began to fall, hot and unrelenting. She staggered to her bed, collapsing onto it as the sobs broke free. The emotions she had fought to keep at bay now overwhelmed her, a tempest of anger, humiliation, and exhaustion.  

She buried her face in her pillow, muffling the sounds of her cries. Her shoulders shook as she let the tears soak through the fabric, the reality of the confrontation cutting deeper than she'd expected. The weight of her family's expectations pressed down on her like an anchor, their voices still echoing in her mind.  

But beneath the heartbreak, a flicker of defiance burned, stubborn and unyielding. Through the tears, Mahrosh whispered to herself, her voice raw but determined, "They don't get to control me. Not Ali. Not anyone."  

The room felt cold and still, but that single spark within her refused to be extinguished. Even as she cried, Mahrosh knew she wouldn't let their judgment define her. She would face this, just as she always had... with strength forged from the fire of her struggles.
