# Chapter 12: **A Descent Into Doubt**

The ride back to campus was tense, neither Mahrosh nor Saim saying a word. Saim told Mahrosh about the marriage suggestion and the weight of Usama's suggestion about marriage loomed over them like a shadow, growing darker with each passing moment. The idea wasn't just unsettling; it was impossible. Yet, the seed of doubt had been planted, and neither could completely ignore it.

As they reached NCA, Mahrosh broke the silence. "You're awfully quiet," she said, her voice tinged with frustration.

Saim parked the bike and removed his helmet, avoiding her gaze. "What do you want me to say, Mahrosh? That I'm okay with any of this? Because I'm not."

Her expression softened, but her frustration didn't wane. "Neither am I, but ignoring it won't help us. We need a real plan, Saim. Not just temporary fixes."

Saim exhaled sharply, finally meeting her eyes. "I know. But marriage? Do you even realize what that means for both of us? For Aisha?"

The mention of Aisha struck a chord, and Mahrosh looked away, guilt flashing across her face. "I didn't ask for this either," she muttered. "And for the record, I don't think marriage is the solution."

"Good," Saim said flatly, his tone leaving no room for further discussion. "Because it's not happening."

Later that evening, Mahrosh sat alone in her room, staring at her laptop screen. The words from Usama's research paper blurred as her mind raced. The visions, the emotional merging. What did it all mean? And how much of herself would she lose if they couldn't stop it?  

Her phone buzzed, breaking her thoughts. It was Saim.  

"Hey," she answered, trying to keep her voice steady.  

"We need to figure this out," he said without preamble. "I've been thinking... maybe we're approaching this the wrong way."  

Mahrosh frowned. "What do you mean?"  

"We've been focusing on the curse and its effects," Saim explained. "But what if we look into the painting itself? Its origin, its history. There has to be a reason why it's doing this to us."  

Mahrosh leaned back in her chair, considering his words. "You're saying we dig deeper?"  

"Exactly," Saim replied. "We can't rely solely on Usama. He's helpful, but if he's right about time running out, we can't afford to wait around."

The next day, Mahrosh and Saim met in the university library. They pored over books and digital archives, searching for anything connected to the painting. Hours passed, but their efforts seemed futile, until Mahrosh stumbled upon a faded, handwritten catalog entry in an old art journal.  

"Look at this," she said, pointing to a passage.  

Saim leaned in, squinting at the text. "The Lady of Shadows," he read aloud. "An oil painting believed to date back to the late 19th century, attributed to an anonymous artist. Rumored to have mystical properties."  

Mahrosh tapped the screen. "It says here that the painting was originally part of a private collection in Europe but vanished for decades before resurfacing in Paris and now in Lahore."  

Saim's brows furrowed. "Mystical properties? That's putting it mildly."  

"Wait," Mahrosh said, scrolling down. "There's more. 'Accounts suggest the painting curses those who disrupt its sanctity, binding their fates together until a balance is restored.'"  

"Balance?" Saim echoed. "What kind of balance?"  

Mahrosh shook her head. "It doesn't say. But this 'Lady of Shadows'... it's definitely our painting."  

As they packed up to leave, Mahrosh's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number.  

'Meet me at the Fine Arts Building rooftop. Midnight. Bring Saim. Usama'  

Mahrosh showed the message to Saim, who frowned. "Why the rooftop? What's with all the dramatic locations?"  

"Do you want to ignore him?" Mahrosh asked pointedly.  

Saim sighed. "No. Let's see what he wants."

Under the pale moonlight, the rooftop of the Fine Arts Building was eerily quiet. Mahrosh and Saim arrived to find Usama standing near the edge, his back to them as he stared out over the campus.  

"You made it," he said without turning around.  

"What's so urgent that it couldn't wait until morning?" Saim asked, crossing his arms.  

Usama turned to face them, his expression grave. "I've been digging into the painting's origin. The Lady of Shadows isn't just cursed... it's a vessel."  

Mahrosh's heart skipped a beat. "A vessel for what?"  

"For her," Usama said simply. "The Old Lady. She isn't just tied to the painting; she inhabits it. And she's searching for a host."  

Saim's stomach sank. "A host?"  

Usama nodded. "She feeds on the bonds she creates, growing stronger until she can fully possess someone. If you two don't break the cycle, she might become her vessel."  

The words hit like a thunderclap, leaving them reeling.  

"What do we do?" Mahrosh whispered, her voice barely audible.  

Usama's gaze hardened. "You dig deeper. Find out who painted her and why. That's the only way you'll understand how to stop her."  

Saim clenched his fists, his mind racing. "And if we don't find anything?"  

Usama's expression didn't waver. "Then you bot to pay the price. And the price is death."  

The silence that followed was deafening, the weight of the curse pressing down on them heavier than ever.  

As they left the rooftop, Mahrosh glanced at Saim, her voice trembling. "What if I can't do this, Saim?"  

"You're not alone," Saim said firmly, though his own fear was palpable. "We'll figure it out. Together."  

But as they descended the stairs, a chilling thought lingered in both their minds: time was running out, and the Lady of Shadows was waiting.
