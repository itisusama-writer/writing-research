# Introduction

It was almost the mid of the year when Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting and Printmaking, Aqeel Ahmed Solangi, Head of Painting and Sculpture, and Esmaeil Arbab Shahestan, Incharge of the Traditional Art & Craft Programme, went out of the way and decided to organize an annual art exhibition at the only best-known art university in Lahore, National College of Arts. This once-in-a-year exhibition is especially for students and faculty members of NCA. 

The main exhibition hall of NCA started filling with various paintings and sculptures from all around the world, but one caught everyoneâ€™s eye. At the heart of this gallery, men in black gloves, led by Chief Security Officer Javed Akhtar, carefully positioned a vintage painting of an elderly woman with deep, penetrating eyes on the wall at the very center of exhibition hall. A painting that captured everyone's attention. It was of an old woman with deep, penetrating eyes that seemed to look right at you.
    
The canvas looked aged, adding to the painting's mysterious feel. Every wrinkle on the woman's face was carefully painted, each one telling a different story. The shadows on her cheeks made her look almost ghostly, and her tightly pressed lips hinted at secrets she was keeping.
    
The background was dark and simple, making the woman stand out even more. Her clothes were plain and worn, suggesting a hard life full of experiences. The painting's realistic details made it both fascinating and a little unsettling, drawing everyone closer to her sad and wise gaze.

This somber ritual caught everyone's attention as a thick rope barrier was set up around the piece. A simple, unsettling sign warned: Do Not Touch the Painting and Do Not Cross the Boundaries... CURSED. The crowd began to murmur. Some people whispered in fear, their faces pale and their eyes wide. 

"Cursed? What does that mean?" one person asked nervously. Others laughed it off, dismissing the sign as a dramatic joke. 

"They can't be serious," someone chuckled, shaking their head. But despite their reactions, everyone was drawn to the painting, their curiosity piqued by the eerie warning.

There were so many rumors about this painting, and many people had felt something weird connected to it. 

"This painting has traveled across continents," Ayesha Mariam Durrani murmured, her voice barely audible. 

"They say its origins are unknown, but every place it has been displayed, someone... changes. People have reported strange phenomena, shadows moving, whispers in the night. In one gallery, a young artist who studied it obsessively disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a cryptic note: 'She watches'."

The crowd murmured as Prof. Dr. Murtaza Jafri, the Vice Chancellor, spoke in low tones to Bushra Saeed Khan, the Acting Registrar. The eerie atmosphere only intensified when Rida Fatima, the Archivist, whispered to a nearby student, "Legend has it, anyone who dares touch it faces... consequences."

The student's eyes widened in a mix of curiosity and fear. "What kind of consequences?" they asked, their voice barely above a whisper. As others overheard, a sense of unease began to spread through the room. Some people exchanged nervous glances, while others tried to act brave, but it was clear that the warning had made everyone feel a bit uneasy.

Mahrosh Javaid Umrani, a 23-year-old with an effortlessly creative aura, and her close-knit bestie Saim Safder, a 25-year-old with an attitude that mirrored Mahrosh's, were standing around the corner of the hall and staring at the cursed painting. 

Mahrosh nudged Saim. "You thinking what I'm thinking?"

Saim grinned. "Our next project." 

They both thought of an opportunity with this painting. A boundary-pushing project, were there with a single focus: to capture the rumored "cursed" painting that had already stirred up whispers among attendees.

Mahrosh felt a thrill of excitement. This was the kind of challenge she loved. She could already imagine the rush of working on something so mysterious and controversial.

Saim, on the other hand, was already picturing how they could use the painting's eerie aura for their project. The haunting eyes and the dark, unsettling vibes would be perfect to add a touch of intrigue and mystery. He thought about how they could play with lighting and angles to amplify the painting's spooky feel. As the whispers around them grew, they knew this was their chance to create something truly unforgettable.

The two navigated the crowd, pretending to film the surroundings. Their curiosity intensified as they saw Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari, the System Manager, setting up cameras around the painting as if trying to catch something on film.

Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari looked cautious and serious. His eyes darted around, checking every detail. "Make sure these angles cover every inch of the painting," he muttered to himself. The cameras he was setting up were sleek and modern, with large lenses and sturdy tripods. He carefully adjusted each one, making sure they were in the right position.

He also had some other equipment with him, like motion sensors and small lights, placing them strategically around the painting. "We can't miss any movement, no matter how small," he said, his voice firm. His focused and meticulous manner made it clear he was determined to capture whatever was happening with the "cursed" painting.

As he worked, a curious onlooker asked, "Do you really think there's something to catch?"

Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari glanced at them, his expression grim. "We'll find out soon enough," he replied, turning back to his task with a determined look.

"Strange, isn't it?" Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari muttered to Faheem Zawar, the IT Administrator.

Faheem replied with a nervous laugh, "More than strange. Haunted, they say."

Syed adjusted another camera, his face serious. "Did you hear about the last place this painting was displayed?" he asked quietly.

Faheem nodded, his eyes widening. "Yeah, some gallery in Europe. They said strange things started happening, lights flickering, cold drafts, even whispers in empty rooms."

Syed glanced at the painting, his expression grim. "And what about the curator who touched it?" he continued.

Faheem's voice dropped to a whisper. "They say he had a series of accidents afterward... broke his leg, his house caught fire, and then..." He hesitated, looking around nervously.

"And then?" Syed prompted.

Faheem swallowed hard. "And then he disappeared. No one knows what happened to him."

Syed's gaze lingered on the painting for a moment before he turned back to his equipment. "Let's hope we can capture something tonight. Whatever it is, we need to know the truth."

Their conversation left a heavy silence in the air, as the tension in the room grew palpable.

Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting and Printmaking, caught Mahrosh's attention with her intense gaze. "You two should leave that painting alone," she said. "Some things are better left in the dark." 

She leaned in closer, her expression full of concern. "Do you know what happened last time someone ignored the warnings?" Ayesha asked, her voice low and serious. "They started having nightmares, seeing strange things... and eventually, they had to leave the university." She's trying really hard to scare them.

Ayesha's eyes revealed she knew more than she was saying, but she chose her words carefully. "I'm telling you this for your own good. Please, don't make the same mistake."

Her warning only fueled Mahrosh and Saim's interest even more, but now they were even more aware of the risks involved.

Mahrosh and Saim stood close to the painting, their eyes taking in every detail. As Mahrosh studied the deep, penetrating eyes of the elderly woman in the painting, she suddenly felt an unusual chill run down her spine. It was as if the room temperature had dropped, and she instinctively wrapped her arms around herself to keep warm.

Meanwhile, Saim noticed something odd. The lighting near the painting flickered for just a moment, casting strange shadows that seemed to dance around the canvas. He blinked and looked again, but everything seemed normal now.

They exchanged uneasy glances, both feeling a mix of excitement and fear. The sense of something mysterious and possibly dangerous hung in the air, leaving them on edge and eager to uncover the truth behind the "cursed" painting.
