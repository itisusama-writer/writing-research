### Chapter 11: **Unraveling Minds**  

Mahrosh stood in front of her bathroom mirror, staring at her reflection as if it belonged to someone else. Her hands gripped the sink, knuckles white as she struggled to steady her breathing. The injection had worked—there was no suffocation, no tightness in her chest—but something about her felt wrong, distorted, as though parts of her mind were no longer her own.  

The reflection in the mirror flickered, her face briefly replaced by Saim’s—his worried eyes staring back at her. She stumbled backward, her pulse racing, but the vision was gone in an instant.  

“Get it together,” she whispered to herself, splashing cold water on her face.  

At NCA later that morning, the unease lingered. She tried to focus on her lecture, but her thoughts kept slipping, as if her mind wasn’t entirely her own. When the class ended, she barely noticed Nur waving at her until her friend grabbed her arm.  

“Mahrosh, are you okay?” Nur asked, her tone laced with concern. “You’ve been zoning out all morning.”  

“I’m fine,” Mahrosh lied, forcing a smile. “Just tired.”  

Nur didn’t look convinced but nodded, releasing her arm. “If you need to talk, I’m here.”  

As Nur walked away, Mahrosh’s phone buzzed. It was a message from Saim:  

**Meet me near the canteen. We need to talk.**

Saim was already seated when Mahrosh arrived, his face pale and drawn. He looked up as she approached, gesturing for her to sit.  

“You look terrible,” Mahrosh said, her voice flat.  

“Thanks,” Saim muttered. “You don’t look so great yourself.”  

Mahrosh hesitated before sitting down, leaning in to speak quietly. “Something’s happening, Saim. I think... I think I’m losing control.”  

Saim’s expression hardened. “You too?”  

She stared at him, her breath catching. “What do you mean, ‘me too’?”  

Saim leaned forward, lowering his voice further. “Last night, after the injection, I started seeing things. Hearing your voice in my head, even when you weren’t around. And today... I feel like I can sense what you’re feeling. Like right now, you’re scared, aren’t you?”  

Mahrosh’s hands trembled slightly as she nodded. “I... I saw your face in my mirror this morning. Just for a second. It’s like... like we’re blending together somehow.”  

Saim’s jaw tightened. “This curse... it’s not just tethering us physically. It’s messing with our minds too.”

### A Call for Help  

Before they could discuss further, Mahrosh’s phone buzzed again. This time, it was Usama.  

“Pick it up,” Saim urged, his voice tense.  

Mahrosh answered, her voice unsteady. “Hello?”  

“Where are you?” Usama’s voice was sharp, urgent.  

“On campus,” she replied. “Why? What’s wrong?”  

“Listen carefully,” Usama said. “The injection may have stabilized your physical symptoms, but it’s triggering something else—your mental connection to the curse. You need to come to my place immediately.”  

Mahrosh glanced at Saim, who nodded. “We’re on our way,” she said before hanging up.

### Usama’s Diagnosis  

Usama’s apartment was a cluttered but organized space, filled with books, artifacts, and strange symbols etched into the walls. He ushered them inside quickly, his demeanor more intense than before.  

“I’ve been doing more research,” he began without preamble. “The Old Lady’s curse isn’t just about proximity. It’s about unity—complete and utter merging of two individuals. The injection has sped up the process, but it’s also deepening your bond.”  

“Deepening how?” Saim asked, his voice sharp.  

“You’re sharing more than energy now,” Usama said grimly. “Memories, emotions, even fragments of your personalities. The curse is trying to force you into a singular existence, two souls becoming one.”  

Mahrosh felt the blood drain from her face. “Is there a way to stop it?”  

Usama hesitated, his gaze flicking between them. “Not entirely. But we can slow it down. You need to resist the merging—stay grounded in who you are. That means avoiding emotional vulnerability, maintaining clear boundaries.”  

“That’s easy for you to say,” Saim snapped. “We’re stuck together all the time. How are we supposed to have boundaries?”  

Usama’s expression darkened. “You’ll have to figure that out. But if you don’t... there’s a chance you won’t just lose yourselves—you could lose your humanity entirely.”

### The Warning  

As they left Usama’s apartment, the weight of his words pressed heavily on their shoulders. Mahrosh and Saim walked in silence for a while, each lost in their own thoughts.  

Finally, Mahrosh broke the silence. “Saim... what if we can’t stop it?”  

“We will,” Saim said firmly, though his voice wavered slightly. “We have to.”  

But deep down, they both knew the truth: the curse was evolving, and their time was running out.
