# Chapter 11: Unraveling Minds  

Mahrosh stood in front of her bathroom mirror, staring at her reflection. It seems like as if it belonged to someone else. Her hands gripped the sink, knuckles white as she struggled to steady her breathing. The injection had worked... there was no suffocation, no tightness in her chest... but something about her felt wrong, so wrong, as though parts of her mind were no longer her own.  

The reflection in the mirror flickered, her face briefly replaced by Saim's. His worried eyes staring back at her for a moment. She stumbled backward, her pulse racing, but the vision was gone in an instant.

"Get it together," she whispered to herself, splashing cold water on her face.  

At NCA later that morning, the unease lingered. She tried to focus on her lecture, but her thoughts keeps on slipping again and again, as if her mind wasn't entirely her own. When the class ended, she barely noticed Nur waving at her until she grabbed her arm.  

"Mahrosh, are you okay?" Nur asked, her tone laced with concern. "You've been zoning out all morning."  

"I'm fine," Mahrosh lied, forcing a smile. "Just tired."  

Nur didn't look convinced but nodded, releasing her arm. "If you need to talk, I'm here."  

As Nur walked away, Mahrosh's phone buzzed. It was a message from Saim:  

'Get free soon and me near the canteen. We need to talk.'

Saim was already seated when Mahrosh arrived, his face pale and drawn. He looked up as she approached, gesturing for her to sit.  

"You look terrible," Mahrosh said, her voice flat.  

"Thanks," Saim muttered. "You don't look so great yourself."  

Mahrosh hesitated before sitting down, leaning in to speak quietly. "Something's happening, Saim. I think... I think I'm losing control."  

Saim's expression hardened. "You losing control?"  

She stared at him. "I... I saw your face in my mirror this morning. Just for a second. It's like... like we're blending together somehow."  

Saim leaned forward, lowering his voice further. "You have my blood in you. This might effect your vision." After a pause Saim continues, "I ignored it all but since we were stuck in this curse... I started hearing a voice saying 'it's over'"

Saim's jaw tightened. "This curse... it's not just tethering us physically. It's messing with our minds too."  

Before they could discuss further, Mahrosh's phone buzzed again. This time, it was Usama.  

"Pick it up," Saim urged, his voice tense.  

Mahrosh answered, her voice unsteady. "Hello?"  

"Where are you?" Usama's voice was sharp, urgent.  

"On campus," she replied. "Why? What's wrong?"  

"Listen carefully," Usama said. "The injection may have stabilized your physical symptoms, but it's triggering something else... your mental connection to the curse. You need to come to my place immediately."  

Mahrosh glanced at Saim, who nodded. "We're on our way," she said before hanging up.

Usama's apartment was a cluttered but organized space, filled with books, artifacts, and strange symbols etched into the walls. He ushered them inside quickly, his demeanor more intense than before.  

"I've been wanting to tell you this in the Pak Tea House..." he began without preamble. "The Old Lady's curse isn't just about proximity. It's about unity. Complete and utter merging of two individuals. The blood injection act's as a bypass whic ovewrites the original effect of the curse, and that's why Mahrosh will have vision issue."  

"Vission issue. Is this dangerous?" Saim asked, his voice sharp.  

"No... This is just what she will see. It won't do anything physically." Usama assured them.

"You're sharing more than energy now," Usama said grimly. "Memories, emotions, even fragments of your personalities. The curse is trying to force you into a singular existence, two souls becoming one."  

Mahrosh felt the blood drain from her face. "Is there a way to stop it?"  

Usama hesitated, his gaze flicking between them. "Not entirely. But we can slow it down. You need to resist the merging. Stay grounded in who you are. That means avoiding emotional vulnerability, maintaining clear boundaries..."  

"Saim... Can we talk?" Usama asked, he again want's time alone with Saim for a moment.

"Not again..." Mahrosh whispered to herself, irritated.

The guys walked away from Mahrosh once again, and this time Saim guessed what it could be. The marriage.

"See Saim. I know it is totally up to you. But if you guys get married this might break the curse completly. Because then you guys are one soul by default and their is no chance for curse to happen. You know our religion allows you to have a second wife."

During the call Usama got a call from someone, name displaying Abubakar. "I have to go right now. It is important."

Mahrosh and Saim left the apartment and this time they are worried and tensed more then ever before. As they left Usama's apartment, the weight of his words pressed heavily on their shoulders. Mahrosh and Saim walked in silence for a while, each lost in their own thoughts.  

Finally, Mahrosh broke the silence. "Saim... what if we can't stop it?"  

"We will," Saim said firmly, though his voice wavered slightly. "We have to."  

But deep down, they both knew the truth: the curse was evolving, and their time was running out.
