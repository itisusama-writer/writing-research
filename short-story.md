The annual art exhibition at the National College of Arts (NCA) drew students and faculty alike, with halls filled with paintings, sculptures, and installations that showcased the artistic prowess of NCA’s best. Mahrosh and Saim, film students known for their bold, boundary-pushing projects, were there with a single focus: to capture the rumored “cursed” painting that had already stirred up whispers among attendees.

At the heart of the gallery, men in black gloves, led by Chief Security Officer Javed Akhtar, carefully positioned a vintage painting of an elderly woman with deep, penetrating eyes. The somber ritual caught everyone’s attention as a thick rope barrier was set up around the piece. A simple, unsettling sign warned: Do Not Touch the Painting and Do Not Cross the Boundaries... CURSED.

The crowd murmured as Prof. Dr. Murtaza Jafri, the Vice Chancellor, spoke in low tones to Bushra Saeed Khan, the Acting Registrar. The eerie atmosphere only intensified when Rida Fatima, the Archivist, whispered to a nearby student, “Legend has it, anyone who dares touch it faces… consequences.”

Mahrosh nudged Saim. “You thinking what I’m thinking?”

Saim grinned. “Our next project.”

The two navigated the crowd, pretending to film the surroundings. Their curiosity intensified as they saw Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari, the System Manager, setting up cameras around the painting, as if trying to catch something on film. “Strange, isn’t it?” he muttered to Faheem Zawar, the IT Administrator, who replied with a nervous laugh, “More than strange. Haunted, they say.”

Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting, caught Mahrosh’s attention with her intense gaze. “You two should leave that painting alone,” she said. “Some things are better left in the dark.” Her warning only fueled their interest.

Ignoring the cautionary looks, Mahrosh and Saim edged closer to the painting, preparing to capture the “haunting” in high resolution. As they leaned in, Mahrosh whispered, “Let’s get a close-up.” Just as they did, both reached out instinctively, their fingers brushing the painting's surface at the same time.

An icy jolt surged through them, sending shivers down their spines. The lights flickered as the room fell silent. For a second, the old woman’s eyes seemed to flash, following their movements.

“Did… did you feel that?” Mahrosh stammered, eyes wide.

Saim nodded, breathless. “We need to go. Now.”

After brushing their fingers against the painting, Mahrosh and Saim exchanged a nervous laugh, the tension breaking just enough for them to bolt away from the exhibit. Giggling, they slipped through the crowded halls, exhilarated by the thrill of their rebellious act.

Once they were outside, the cool evening air welcomed them, a refreshing contrast to the stifling atmosphere of the gallery. Mahrosh leaned against a nearby pillar, still catching her breath, when she noticed Saim glancing down at his wrist with a frown.

“Hey, what’s up?” she asked, still grinning.

Saim held up his right wrist, revealing a strange, dark mark forming—a faint outline, almost like a bruise, spreading across his skin in an unfamiliar shape. “I don’t know,” he murmured, rubbing at it. “It doesn’t hurt, but… it’s weird.”

Mahrosh took a step closer to examine the unusual mark on Saim’s wrist, her curiosity undiminished. The mark was dark, almost unnatural, standing out starkly against his skin. They exchanged a tense glance, both uneasy but trying to brush it off.

“Guess we really got what we asked for,” Saim joked weakly, attempting to lighten the mood.

Mahrosh forced a smile. “Maybe it's just a weird reaction to the paint or something.”

They walked together, trying to shake off the unsettling experience. But as they moved away from each other slightly more 2 meters, a strange sensation settled over Mahrosh. She started to feel a tightness in her chest and a subtle difficulty in catching her breath.

Noticing her discomfort, Saim stepped back toward her, and just as suddenly, she felt normal. They looked at each other, a spark of realization dawning on their faces.

“Wait,” Mahrosh said, “What if…?”

The two cautiously took small steps away from each other, only to find that once they crossed a certain distance, the feeling of suffocation crept back over her, retreating again as Saim stepped back closer.

They exchanged worried looks. Something was definitely wrong, and it seemed that whatever bound them now was more than just a mark on Saim’s wrist—it was something far darker, and it kept them tethered in a way neither had anticipated.

"Saim... We need to be together. We are stuck." Mahrosh said in disblief.

As the unsettling reality of their situation dawned on them, Saim took a step back, scratching his head in disbelief.

"Mahrosh, I... can't be here like this. You know I'm married," he said, voice laced with frustration and concern. “Staying with you like this—it’s going to create problems.”

Mahrosh’s heart sank as the enormity of the situation hit her. She looked away, her face growing pale. “But… what am I supposed to do?” she whispered. “I can’t breathe when you’re not close. It’s like… it’s like I’m being strangled from the inside.” Her voice broke slightly, betraying her fear.

Saim shook his head, his gaze darting around as if searching for answers. “There has to be a way to break this… connection. Maybe it’s just temporary. Maybe it fades after a while.”

They stood in silence, the weight of the situation pressing down on them both. The only sounds were their own breaths and the distant hum of students still lingering near the exhibition hall. Finally, Saim spoke up, his voice low.

“Look,” he said, “I’ll try to find a way around this without... causing issues with my wife. But Mahrosh, if this curse or whatever it is doesn’t break soon, we’ll have to find another solution.”

Mahrosh nodded, though a wave of dread washed over her at the thought of Saim leaving her side. “Okay… but can we at least find someone who knows more about that painting?” she asked.
