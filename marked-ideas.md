# Ideas Sequencing:

- **The Influence of a Ghostly Muse:** Students might feel influenced by a "muse" that seems more like a haunting presence, inspiring them in disturbing ways, pushing them to create dark, uncharacteristic art that reflects hidden fears or desires.
- **Urban Legends on Campus:** Incorporate local urban legends or myths that become real within your story. These could include sightings of spectral figures, a campus "curse," or strange events happening at certain times of night.
- **Possessed Artifacts or Cursed Objects:** Items like an ancient sculpture or a canvas that is rumored to be cursed. Whoever touches it or works with it experiences inexplicable fear or is drawn into sinister events.
- **Messages Left in Artwork:** Art projects may reveal strange symbols or hidden messages that, when deciphered, reveal a chilling story or a link to past events that need unraveling.
