# Ideas Sequencing:

- **The Influence of a Ghostly Presence:** Students might feel influenced by a ghostly presence that seems more like a haunting presence, inspiring them in disturbing ways, pushing them to create dark, uncharacteristic art that reflects hidden fears or desires.
- **Urban Legends on Campus:** Incorporate local urban legends or myths that become real within your story. These could include sightings of spectral figures, a campus "curse," or strange events happening at certain times of night.
- **Possessed Artifacts or Cursed Objects:** Items like an ancient sculpture or a canvas that is rumored to be cursed. Whoever touches it or works with it experiences inexplicable fear or is drawn into sinister events.

(This will stay as the ending placeholder for the story and will be used if needed)
- **Messages Left in Artwork:** Art projects may reveal strange symbols or hidden messages that, when deciphered, reveal a chilling story or a link to past events that need unraveling.

# Main Idea (Rough):

During an annual art exhibition at the National College of Arts (NCA), a group of mysterious men, clad in gloves, silently approach the exhibit. With an air of solemnity, they carefully place the vintage painting of the old woman at the center of the room, encircling it with ropes and setting up a sign that warns, "Do Not Touch the Painting and Do Not Cross the Boundaries... CURSED." Their actions are deliberate, almost ritualistic, as if the painting commands an unusual reverence. 

Once the men retreat, attendees feel an uncanny chill settle over the room. Those who linger near the painting can't shake the sensation of its ghostly presence or the creeping suspicion that it holds a dark influence. Whispers ripple through the crowd as students and visitors exchange uneasy glances, wondering what grim history or curse surrounds this haunting work of art-and why it needed to be displayed with such caution.

As film students drawn to unique stories, Mahrosh and Saim become intrigued by the "cursed" painting and decide it's perfect for their next project. Ignoring the warning, they lean in to capture a closer shot-both reaching out instinctively, their fingers brushing the painting's surface at the same time.
