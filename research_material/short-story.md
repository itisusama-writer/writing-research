## This short story will grow by time and then will be breakdown into chapters

The annual art exhibition at the National College of Arts (NCA) drew students and faculty alike, with halls filled with paintings, sculptures, and installations that showcased the artistic prowess of NCA's best. Mahrosh and Saim, film students known for their bold, boundary-pushing projects, were there with a single focus: to capture the rumored "cursed" painting that had already stirred up whispers among attendees.

At the heart of the gallery, men in black gloves, led by Chief Security Officer Javed Akhtar, carefully positioned a vintage painting of an elderly woman with deep, penetrating eyes. The somber ritual caught everyone's attention as a thick rope barrier was set up around the piece. A simple, unsettling sign warned: Do Not Touch the Painting and Do Not Cross the Boundaries... CURSED.

The crowd murmured as Prof. Dr. Murtaza Jafri, the Vice Chancellor, spoke in low tones to Bushra Saeed Khan, the Acting Registrar. The eerie atmosphere only intensified when Rida Fatima, the Archivist, whispered to a nearby student, "Legend has it, anyone who dares touch it faces... consequences."

Mahrosh nudged Saim. "You thinking what I'm thinking?"

Saim grinned. "Our next project."

The two navigated the crowd, pretending to film the surroundings. Their curiosity intensified as they saw Syed Hussain Ali Bukhari, the System Manager, setting up cameras around the painting, as if trying to catch something on film. "Strange, isn't it?" he muttered to Faheem Zawar, the IT Administrator, who replied with a nervous laugh, "More than strange. Haunted, they say."

Ayesha Mariam Durrani, Head of Miniature Painting, caught Mahrosh's attention with her intense gaze. "You two should leave that painting alone," she said. "Some things are better left in the dark." Her warning only fueled their interest.

Ignoring the cautionary looks, Mahrosh and Saim edged closer to the painting, preparing to capture the "haunting" in high resolution. As they leaned in, Mahrosh whispered, "Let's get a close-up." Just as they did, both reached out instinctively, their fingers brushing the painting's surface at the same time.

An icy jolt surged through them, sending shivers down their spines. The lights flickered as the room fell silent. For a second, the old woman's eyes seemed to flash, following their movements.

"Did... did you feel that?" Mahrosh stammered, eyes wide.

Saim nodded, breathless. "We need to go. Now."

After brushing their fingers against the painting, Mahrosh and Saim exchanged a nervous laugh, the tension breaking just enough for them to bolt away from the exhibit. Giggling, they slipped through the crowded halls, exhilarated by the thrill of their rebellious act.

Once they were outside, the cool evening air welcomed them, a refreshing contrast to the stifling atmosphere of the gallery. Mahrosh leaned against a nearby pillar, still catching her breath, when she noticed Saim glancing down at his wrist with a frown.

"Hey, what's up?" she asked, still grinning.

Saim held up his right wrist, revealing a strange, dark mark forming—a faint outline, almost like a bruise, spreading across his skin in an unfamiliar shape. "I don't know," he murmured, rubbing at it. "It doesn't hurt, but... it's weird."

Mahrosh took a step closer to examine the unusual mark on Saim's wrist, her curiosity undiminished. The mark was dark, almost unnatural, standing out starkly against his skin. They exchanged a tense glance, both uneasy but trying to brush it off.

"Guess we really got what we asked for," Saim joked weakly, attempting to lighten the mood.

Mahrosh forced a smile. "Maybe it's just a weird reaction to the paint or something."

They walked together, trying to shake off the unsettling experience. But as they moved away from each other slightly more 2 meters, a strange sensation settled over Mahrosh. She started to feel a tightness in her chest and a subtle difficulty in catching her breath.

Noticing her discomfort, Saim stepped back toward her, and just as suddenly, she felt normal. They looked at each other, a spark of realization dawning on their faces.

"Wait," Mahrosh said, "What if...?"

The two cautiously took small steps away from each other, only to find that once they crossed a certain distance, the feeling of suffocation crept back over her, retreating again as Saim stepped back closer.

They exchanged worried looks. Something was definitely wrong, and it seemed that whatever bound them now was more than just a mark on Saim's wrist—it was something far darker, and it kept them tethered in a way neither had anticipated.

"Saim... We need to be together. We are stuck." Mahrosh said in disblief.

As the unsettling reality of their situation dawned on them, Saim took a step back, scratching his head in disbelief.

"Mahrosh, I... can't be here like this. You know I'm married," he said, voice laced with frustration and concern. "Staying with you like this - it's going to create problems."

Mahrosh's heart sank as the enormity of the situation hit her. She looked away, her face growing pale. "But... what am I supposed to do?" she whispered. "I can't breathe when you're not close. It's like... it's like I'm being strangled from the inside." Her voice broke slightly, betraying her fear.

Saim shook his head, his gaze darting around as if searching for answers. "There has to be a way to break this... connection. Maybe it's just temporary. Maybe it fades after a while."

They stood in silence, the weight of the situation pressing down on them both. The only sounds were their own breaths and the distant hum of students still lingering near the exhibition hall. Finally, Saim spoke up, his voice low.

"Look," he said, "I'll try to find a way around this without... causing issues with my wife. But Mahrosh, if this curse or whatever it is doesn't break soon, we'll have to find another solution."

Mahrosh nodded, though a wave of dread washed over her at the thought of Saim leaving her side. "Okay... but can we at least find someone who knows more about that painting?" she asked.

Mahrosh's mind raced, searching for anything that might offer a solution. Then it hit her—the book she'd noticed near the painting display. She remembered it had looked old, with a cracked leather cover, its pages dense with strange, looping script. Maybe, just maybe, it held answers.

Without a second thought, she turned and sprinted toward the exhibition hall, barely registering Saim's shout as she broke the invisible two-meter boundary. The tightness gripped her chest, each step harder than the last. She stumbled, wheezing, and stopped, clutching her throat as panic flooded her.

Saim quickly caught up, his face etched with worry. "Mahrosh, are you insane? You can't just—" He cut himself off, realizing her desperation. He took her arm, steadying her.

"There's a book near the painting," Mahrosh gasped. "It might explain... all this."

Saim glanced back toward the exhibition hall and nodded. Together, they hurried back through the quieting corridors, feeling the weight of curious eyes as they slipped past lingering students and faculty. Finally, they reached the painting, the old woman's eyes seeming to watch them with silent amusement.

There, lying just off to the side on a small, dark wooden stand, was the book. Saim picked it up gingerly, and they examined it together, the leather cover worn and embossed with intricate designs. As they opened it, Mahrosh's heart sank. The script was unfamiliar, flowing in elaborate, unreadable patterns.

"It's... Arabic, I think," Saim murmured, his brow furrowing. "But we don't have a clue what any of this means."

"Maybe... someone else does." Mahrosh scanned the hall, her gaze landing on Professor Ahmed, a linguistics instructor known for his knowledge of ancient languages. She didn't hesitate, pulling Saim along as they approached him.

"Sir!" Mahrosh called out, and Professor Ahmed turned, eyebrows raised as he noticed the book in Saim's hands.

"Young lady, where did you find that?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.

"By the painting," Mahrosh explained breathlessly. "We think... we think it might have something to do with what's happening to us."

Professor Ahmed looked from her to Saim, as if weighing the seriousness of their request. Finally, he nodded. "Bring it by my office tomorrow," he said. "If there's anything in here about that painting's... effects, I'll do my best to find it."

Mahrosh exhaled, feeling a flicker of hope. "Thank you, sir. We'll be here first thing."

As they turned to leave, she and Saim exchanged a look. Tomorrow held no guarantees, but it was a start. And for now, as unsettling as their forced closeness felt, at least they weren't facing it alone.

Saim sighed, glancing at Mahrosh with a mix of frustration and concern. He knew he couldn't leave her—not like this. He took out his phone, hesitating as he dialed his wife's number. The ring felt like it lasted forever, and when she finally answered, her voice was warm and familiar, grounding him amidst all the chaos.

"Hey, Saim," she said brightly, sensing his hesitation. "Everything okay?"

Saim took a breath, trying to gather his thoughts. "Something... strange happened at the exhibition tonight," he began. "Mahrosh and I touched this old painting, and... well, I know this sounds insane, but it's like we're cursed or something. Every time we get more than a couple meters apart, Mahrosh can't breathe." He paused, waiting for her reaction.

There was a brief silence, then a soft, incredulous laugh. "You're serious, aren't you?" she said, her tone switching from amusement to concern.

"Dead serious," he replied, casting a glance at Mahrosh, who was clutching her arms tightly, avoiding his gaze. "I can't leave her alone, not until we figure this out. I wanted to know if... well, if you'd mind if she stayed with us tonight."

To his relief, his wife's response was immediate and understanding. "Of course, Saim. Bring her. This sounds terrifying, and I'm sure she must be shaken up."

Saim felt a weight lift off his shoulders. "Thank you, really. I knew you'd understand."

His wife chuckled, her voice full of warmth. "I've heard of some strange things, but this... let's just say you'll have to tell me everything."

As he hung up, he looked at Mahrosh, who gave him a weak smile. "Your wife... she's okay with this?"

"Yeah, she is," he said, feeling a sense of calm for the first time that evening. "She'll help us figure this out too."

Mahrosh texted her father, "I am staying at my friends home... I will be back home tomorrow." She lied, but it seems to be the only way for her. She can't just say, "I am spending a night with a boy." 

They left the college together, the looming presence of the cursed painting still weighing on their minds. Mahrosh kept close as they walked, still tense from their shared ordeal. By the time they arrived at Saim's apartment, the fatigue of the night was settling over them, a strange heaviness as they prepared to face the unknown.

Saim's wife, Aisha, greeted them at the door with a warm smile, pulling Mahrosh into a gentle hug. "You're safe here," she reassured her. "Whatever's going on, we'll figure it out together."

Mahrosh felt a surge of gratitude, her fear momentarily easing. She wasn't alone. Together, they would face whatever darkness lay ahead, and somehow, they would find a way to break free of the curse.

In the dimly lit dining room, the three of them sat in silence, the weight of the curse pressing down on them. Mahrosh absently traced a finger around the rim of her glass, her mind racing. Saim's wife, Aisha, studied Mahrosh with a gentle, thoughtful gaze, doing her best to appear unruffled by the strange predicament they had found themselves in.

Finally, Mahrosh broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. “Why am I the only one having trouble breathing?”

Aisha leaned back, glancing thoughtfully between Mahrosh and Saim. “It’s strange, definitely,” she agreed, “but maybe there’s a reason for it… perhaps it’s something to do with gender?”

Saim raised an eyebrow, exchanging a puzzled look with Mahrosh. “Gender?” he repeated, uncertain. “How could that make a difference?”

Aisha hesitated, organizing her thoughts. “Think about it,” she explained slowly, “if the curse binds based on a need for connection, maybe it manifests differently depending on who the connection is with. If Mahrosh were tethered to another woman, maybe they’d both feel the same symptoms, like the suffocation. But with you—”

“You’re saying that the curse affects us differently because he’s a man?” Mahrosh finished, her eyes widening. “So that’s why I’m suffocating, but Saim’s not.”

“Possibly,” Aisha nodded. “I’ve read about curses in folklore that affect people differently, depending on things like family ties, gender, or even specific fears or vulnerabilities.” She paused, glancing at Saim. “And it doesn’t necessarily mean the same effects for each person.”

Saim shook his head, frowning as he tried to piece it together. “So the curse is trying to keep us close—specifically close enough for Mahrosh not to feel that… suffocation. And since we’re not bound in the same way, she’s the one suffering if we’re too far apart.”

A silence fell over the room as the implications of Aisha’s theory settled in. Mahrosh’s hands began to shake slightly, and she clenched them tightly together to steady herself. “So, what do we do?” she whispered, glancing up at Saim and Aisha. “If this curse is tied to gender, how do we break it?”

Aisha considered this, her face calm but eyes sharp with determination. “There might be a way. If it is gender-based, we need to test whether the curse behaves the same way with someone else—a woman who hasn’t yet touched the painting.” She looked at Mahrosh with a hint of hesitation. “Someone you trust, who could potentially take Saim’s place, even just to understand the curse’s boundaries.”

Mahrosh’s eyes widened in alarm. “You’re suggesting that I… ask another woman to touch it?” The very thought sent a chill down her spine.

“I know it sounds risky,” Aisha said softly, “but we need answers. And if it means we can lessen your suffering… it might be worth trying.”

The room fell into tense silence as Mahrosh, Saim, and Aisha weighed the decision ahead. The path forward was uncertain, and whatever lay beyond it would demand even more courage and trust than they had shown so far.

Saim’s face darkened as he absorbed Aisha’s suggestion, his jaw clenching. “Absolutely not,” he said firmly, his tone leaving no room for debate. “First, the painting won’t even be there anymore. It was a temporary display for the exhibition, so there’s no chance of anyone else touching it. And second,” he added, his eyes narrowing as he looked from Aisha to Mahrosh, “I won’t allow anyone—Mahrosh, you, or anyone else—to go near that cursed thing. It’s dangerous. We’ll find another way to break this curse.”

Mahrosh sighed, feeling the tension in the room grow thick enough to cut through. She appreciated Saim’s protectiveness, but there was a stubborn streak in his voice that made the situation feel all the more hopeless. Aisha pressed her lips together, giving her husband a sidelong look but not pushing the issue further.

Sensing the growing heaviness of the conversation, Saim leaned back in his chair, suddenly flashing a mischievous grin. “Alright, Mahrosh,” he said, crossing his arms with an exaggeratedly relaxed air, “since I’ve risked my life—on multiple occasions now—trying to keep you alive, I think it’s time you paid me back.”

Mahrosh’s eyebrows shot up, her anxiety momentarily pushed aside by surprise. “What?”

“Tea,” he said, with a smug smile. “A nice, steaming cup. Oh, and don’t forget to press my shoulders. My muscles are all sore from chasing after you.” He raised an eyebrow, clearly trying to lighten the mood. “If you disobey, just saying, I might decide to test the curse myself… by running right out the door.”

Mahrosh gaped at him, caught between exasperation and a reluctant smile. “Saim, that’s not fair!”

“Hey, we all have to make sacrifices,” he replied, smirking. “Now, tea—and maybe a little shoulder massage, if you please.” He leaned forward, pretending to stretch his legs toward the door. “Or I might just make a break for it.”

Aisha let out a surprised laugh, shaking her head. “Saim, really?” she teased, clearly amused. “You’re blackmailing her into making tea?”

“Not just tea,” he corrected, grinning wider. “Tea with a side of obedience.” He leaned back, winking at Mahrosh. “Now get to it before I change my mind.”

Mahrosh rolled her eyes, feigning annoyance but feeling a smile tugging at her lips as she stood up, moving toward the kitchen. “Fine, but don’t think this makes you any less cursed,” she muttered. “You’re more cursed than ever.”

As she filled the kettle, the laughter that followed her was warm and genuine, softening the edges of the grim reality they all faced.

The next morning, the gravity of their situation weighed heavily as Saim and Mahrosh walked towards Professor Ahmed's office. The campus was bustling with the usual activity, but for them, it felt like they were walking through a fog.

Arriving at the professor's office, Saim knocked gently on the door. "Come in," came the familiar voice, and they stepped inside, the old book clutched tightly in Saim's hand.

Professor Ahmed looked up from his desk, his sharp eyes focused on the duo. "You two seem to have had quite a night," he remarked, motioning for them to sit. "Let's see this book you mentioned."

Saim handed over the book, and the professor began to leaf through it with practiced ease. As he scanned the ancient text, his brow furrowed in concentration. After a long moment, he looked up, his expression serious.

"This is not a simple curse," he began. "It is deeply rooted in ancient rituals and requires more than just a quick fix. However, there is mention of a way to temporarily alleviate the symptoms." He paused, making sure they were following. "To store energy."

Mahrosh and Saim exchanged puzzled looks. "Store energy?" Mahrosh repeated.

Professor Ahmed nodded. "The book suggests that physical touch can store energy between the cursed individuals. This stored energy can give you temporary relief from the curse's effects."

"How does it work?" Saim asked, his curiosity piqued.

"According to the text, engaging in some form of physical contact—holding hands, hugging, or even kissing—for an extended period can store enough energy to keep the curse at bay for a limited time. If you maintain physical contact for about an hour, Mahrosh will have approximately 24 hours of freedom from the curse's effects."

Mahrosh blushed slightly at the thought but nodded. "Alright, if that's what it takes."

Outside the office, Mahrosh and Saim exchanged awkward glances. The idea of physical touch to store energy felt strange and uncomfortable.

"I am not kissing you," Mahrosh declared firmly.

"Neither do I," Saim replied, equally resolute.

With a sigh, Mahrosh extended her left hand and interlocked her fingers with Saim's right hand. "Eww," Saim muttered, but he didn't pull away. Mahrosh used her scarf to tie their hands together, ensuring they wouldn't accidentally separate.

They went about their day, attending classes and completing tasks with their hands bound together. The sight of them holding hands drew curious stares and whispers from their classmates. Many assumed they were a couple deeply in love.

"We are just best friends... and I am married," Saim kept repeating to anyone who asked, but the amused looks and knowing smiles continued.

Despite the awkwardness and the sweatiness of their palms, they managed to store enough energy to give Mahrosh some relief from the curse. As the day went on, they found themselves laughing at the absurdity of their situation, their bond growing stronger with each shared moment.
