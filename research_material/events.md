# How these events could impact the story?

1. üö®**Farewell Festival**: The lighthearted nature of this event contrasts with the curse. Perhaps Mahrosh or Saim encounters another ‚Äúvictim‚Äù of the painting, or a former student who knows something about it.

2. **Open Mic Night**: As Mahrosh and Saim attend this event to relax, someone could perform a cryptic poem or story eerily similar to their situation. This mysterious speaker could be a key character in unraveling the curse.

3. **Qawali Evening by Yaar Ali Jaan**: This soulful event might bring a moment of introspection or an encounter with an older faculty member who recognizes the markings on Saim‚Äôs wrist and warns them of its history.

4. üö®**Sports Week**: This is an obstacle if they must stay close to each other. Saim might try participating, but finds he can't be away from Mahrosh, risking both his safety and theirs.

5. üö®**Blood Donation Camp**: Mahrosh and Saim decide to visit in hopes of learning about or resolving the curse. Perhaps a mystical connection to blood or spirit unveils more about the curse‚Äôs origins or intensifies its effects.

6. **Welcome Festival**: An ideal opportunity for them to meet incoming students, possibly adding another cursed individual into the mix, making them realize the painting has impacted others.

7. **Alumni Dinner**: The alumni gathering brings back people who may have past encounters with the curse or the painting, allowing them to gather information about its origin.

8. **Degree Show**: As the culmination of their academic journey, this event could bring an intense culmination to the curse‚Äôs effects, perhaps forcing them to make a final sacrifice or choice to break it, with the painting itself possibly reappearing.
